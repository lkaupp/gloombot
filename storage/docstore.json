When the box is first opened, the Brute  , Tinkerer   , Spellweaver  , Scoundrel  , Cragheart  , and Mindthief   are available.\r\nOnce a character class has been chosen, the player takes the corresponding character mat, character tokens, and that character's starting hand of Level 1 ability cards from the larger tuck box containing the character's symbol, as well as the miniature contained in the smaller character tuck box.A CHARACTER MAT INCLUDES:\r\n*\tA portrait  , icon  , and name  of the class.\r\n*\tIndicators of the maximum hit points at each level  of the class.

These reference numbers apply to both city and road event decks.\r\nH umans are by far the most dominant of the races, spreading across the continent like locusts, erecting extravagant cities and disturbing slumbering forces they can never hope to understand. The human society is one of rules and regulations, but also one of great diversity. Due to their intense curiosity and relentless nature, humans can find themselves walking almost any path imaginable - from the obscenely wealthy noble to the unappreciated tavern cook; from the blacksmith forging rugged weaponry to the corrupted pursuant of dark magics.It is natural, then, that while many humans work to build up complex and constricting bureaucratic societies, there are others who reject such societies or even work to tear them down. Scoundrels are among this second type, wholly unscrupulous and self-serving. Scoundrels operate under the assumption that everything in the world is theirs to take and they will do whatever is necessary to do the taking. Such an attitude manifests itself in combat through a vicious opportunism unseen in any other culture. Character Ability Cards Playing ability cards is what allows a character to perform actions in a scenario.

Character Ability Cards Playing ability cards is what allows a character to perform actions in a scenario. Each round players choose two ability cards and use the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other card, resulting in two actions for each player on his or her turn. All ability cards are specific to a character class and are acquired when starting a new character or by leveling up.AN ABILITY CARD INCLUDES:*\tThe name of the ability  .\r\n*\tAn initiative number  . The initiative number of the leading card played determines a player's order in the initiative of a given round (see Determining Initiative on p. 18 for more details).\r\n*\tThe level of the class card  . A character starting at Level 1 can only use their Level 1 cards (or, alternately,   cards), but a character gains more powerful cards as they level up to add to their pool of available ability cards.\r\n*\tA top action  and bottom action  . When the two ability cards are played on a player's turn, one is used for the top action and the other for the bottom action. Note that a single action can contain several separate abilities  . (See Character Turn on pp. 18-28 for more details on character actions.) Item cards are acquired by spending gold in between scenarios or looting specific treasure tiles. All item cards a character equips will be placed below his or her character mat and can be used during a battle to augment his or her abilities. Item cards are not class-specific, so any character can use any item. However, characters are limited in the number of items they can equip (bring into a scenario). Each character can equip only one  item, one  item, one   item, up to two  items OR one  item, and up to a number of  equal to half their level, rounded up. Characters cannot own more than one copy of any item card. AN ITEM CARD INCLUDES:\r\n*\tThe name of the item  and the amount of gold a character must pay to acquire the item from the shop  .\r\n*\tWhat happens to the card after it is used  .o\t This symbol   means the item is spent after use, which is denoted by rotating the card to its side. Spent cards can be refreshed when a character performs a long rest (see Resting on p. 17 for more details). Sometimes an item is used multiple times before it is spent or consumed. This is depicted by use slots  on the card and can be tracked using a character token.o\t This symbol  (not pictured) means the item is consumed after use, which is shown by flipping the card facedown. Consumed cards can only be refreshed during a scenario by specific abilities. All items are refreshed between scenarios. No item can be permanently consumed.o\t If a card depicts neither of these symbols, there are no restrictions on the number of times it can be used during a scenario, other than what is written in the text of the card.\r\n*\tWhen the item can be used and the bonus gained by the character when the item card is used  .\r\n*\tThe equip slot (Head, Body, Legs, One Hand, Two Hands, Small Item) the item occupies  .\r\n*\tSome equipped items add a number of   cards to the equipping character's attack modifier deck at the start of a scenario.

These traits are permanent and persist from round to round. These traits may include Flying, which is symbolized by       next to the monster's name (see Move on p. 19 for details). A monster stat sleeve should be used to track damage and condition tokens and to hide the unneeded information for other unused levels.\r\nAbility Cards Each round, after players have selected their own ability cards, one card is played for each monster type currently on the board from their respective decks of monster ability cards. These cards determine which abilities each monster of that type--both normal and elite--will perform during the round on its turn.\r\n\r\nA MONSTER ABILITY CARD INCLUDES:*\tThe name of the monster type  . Sometimes, multiple monster types use the same, more generic ability deck. For instance, Bandit Guards, City Guards, and Inox Guards all use the same \"Guard\" deck.\r\n*\tAn initiative number  . This number will determine when every monster of that type will act in a given round (see Determining Initiative on p. 18 for details).\r\n*\tA list of abilities  . A monster will perform each of these abilities in the order listed (if possible) and then end its turn (see Monster Turn on pp. 29-32 for details).\r\n*\tA shuffle symbol  . If this symbol appears on a card, shuffle the corresponding monster's ability discard pile back into the draw deck at the end of the round.Battle Goal CardsAt the beginning of every scenario, each character receives two battle goal cards in secret and chooses one to keep, discarding the other. If the scenario is successfully completed and the character meets the criteria of the chosen card  , he or she will earn a number of checkmarks as specified on the bottom of the card  . Checkmarks are used to enhance a player's attack modifier deck (see Additional Perks on p. 44 for details). If the scenario resulted in failure, the character receives nothing from his or her battle goal card, regardless of whether the goal was achieved. Players can keep track of their battle goal progress using notes if necessary. Players should keep their battle goals secret from one another until the scenario is over.Have fi ve or more total cards in your hand and discard at the end of the scenario.\r\nAttack Modifier Cards AN ATTACK MODIFIER CARD INCLUDES:\r\nAny time an Attack ability is performed, a separate attack modifier card is drawn for each individual target of the attack. Players draw from the personal attack modifier deck for their chosen character and monsters draw from a collective monster deck. The modifier listed on the card is then applied to the attack, possibly reducing or increasing its numerical value.The value of the modifier for the attack  . A \"Null\" symbol   means that no damage is done by the attack. A \"2x\" symbol   means the attack value is doubled.Conditions, elemental infusions, or other special effects of the attack  .

Then read the introduction text and apply any negative scenario effects from the \"Special Rules\" section. Next, two battle goals should be dealt to each player, one of which will be discarded. Players can then decide which items they would like to equip from the collection of items they own (adding in -1 cards to their attack modifier decks when applicable). Next, players should decide which ability cards they would like to put in their hand, choosing from the pool of those available to them. A player must select a number of cards equal to his or her character's hand size. When first starting the game, a player's hand should only consist of the set of Level 1  ability cards for the character's class. Once a player has become familiar with the class, he or she can begin substituting out Level 1 cards for the more complex cards with  as the level.

As you descend, you gratefully notice light emanating from below. Unfortunately, the light is accompanied by the unmistakable stench of death. You contemplate what kind of thieves would make their camp in such a horrid place as you reach the bottom of the steps. Here you find your answer--a rough group of cutthroats who don't seem to have taken very kindly to your sudden appearance. One in the back matches the description of your quarry.\"Take care of these unfortunates,\" he says, backing out of the room. You can vaguely make out his silhouette as he retreats down a hallway and through a door to his left.\"Well, it's not every day we get people stupid enough to hand-deliver their valuables to us,\" grins one of the larger bandits, unsheathing a rusty blade. \"We'll be killing you now.\" Joke's on them. If you had any valuables, you probably wouldn't be down here in the first place.Introduction :Kill all enemiesGoal : NoneRequirements : # 1G-10fgstuvrhijmnpolabcdkefgihjkabcdeX113Two CharactersFour CharactersThree CharactersTwo CharactersFour CharactersThree Characters*\tAny locations the scenario links to (  ; see Traveling and Road Events on pp. 41-42 for details).\r\n*\tThe configuration of map tiles  and door tiles  to be placed during setup.

Monster standees each have a number to determine the order in which they act during the turn (see Order of Action on p. 29 for details). The standee numbers should be randomized when placed.\r\n*\tThe available starting character locations, depicted by     . Players can choose to place their figures on any empty  hex at the start of the scenario.\r\n*\tThe type of traps used in this scenario  and the reward for looting any treasure tiles on the board  . The numbers for the treasures are referenced in the back of the Scenario Book, so that rewards are kept secret.\r\n*\tLocations of money tokens  and overlay tiles  to be placed on the map when the room tile is revealed.\r\nTYPES OF OVERLAY TILES:*\tDoors . A door acts as a separation between two rooms. When a character moves onto a closed door tile, they immediately flip over the door tile to the open side, revealing the adjacent room tile. Immediately place overlay tiles, monsters, and money tokens as indicated in the scenario description for the revealed room. While closed doors do not hinder character movement at all, they act as a wall for any monsters or character-summoned figures, and figures cannot be forced through a closed door. Open doors do not hinder any movement and cannot be closed. Door art varies by environment type, but they all function exactly the same.\r\n*\tCorridors . A corridor is placed on the connection of two map tiles to cover the walls and create a single room out of multiple map tiles. Corridors act like normal empty hexes.\r\n*\tTraps . A trap is sprung when a figure enters its hex with normal or forced movement. Flying  and Jump  movements are unaffected by traps. When a trap is sprung, it inflicts some negative effect on the figure who sprung it and then it is removed from the board. A trap can also be disarmed through specific actions to remove it from the board without suffering its negative effects. Trap effects are varied and are specified in the Scenario Book. If part of a trap's effect is listed as \"damage,\" the trap will inflict 2+L damage on the affected figure, where L is the scenario level. Characters and monsters can also create traps on the board, with the effects specified by the ability that creates the trap. Whenever a trap is placed on the board, tokens for the damage and effects the trap applies should be placed on top of the trap tile for easy reference.\r\n*\tHazardous terrain . If a figure enters a hex with hazardous terrain via normal or forced movement, each hex will inflict half the damage of a trap (rounded down). Flying  and Jump  movements are unaffected by hazardous terrain. Unlike traps, hazardous terrain does not get removed after its effect is applied, but instead remains on the board indefinitely. Starting a turn on or exiting these hexes does not cause additional damage.\r\n*\tDifficult terrain . It takes a figure two normal movement points to enter a hex with difficult terrain. Flying  , Jump  , and forced movements are unaffected by difficult terrain. \r\n*\tObstacles . Obstacles have varying artwork, but they all have the same function: figures cannot move through obstacles with a normal movement, but can move through them with a Flying  or Jump  movement. Obstacles do not hinder ranged attacks. It is possible for certain character abilities to create or move obstacles. When doing so, players can never completely cut off one area of the scenario map from another, such that the area cannot be moved into without going through the obstacles.\r\nOverlay Tiles A scenario is constructed from a set of map tiles as instructed in the Scenario Book.

Additionally, there will be special overlay tiles to fill out the encounter.15*\tTreasure . Treasure tiles can be looted by a player (see Loot on p. 27 for details) for a variety of effects. There are two types of treasure tiles: \"goal\" tiles and numbered tiles. Goal tiles are important for the completion of a scenario, and the rules for looting them will be specified by the scenario. \"Goal\" tiles are reset every time a scenario is played. Numbered tiles can provide a number of different benefits. When one is looted, the looting player should immediately reference the number of the tile with the treasure index in the back of the scenario book to discover what was looted.  If a specific item name is listed, find this item in the deck of unique items and immediately add it to your pool of items. If an item design is listed, find all copies of that item and add them to the city's available supply. Numbered treasure tiles can only be looted once. After they have been looted, they should be crossed off in the Scenario Book as a reminder.Monster base statistics, trap damage, the amount of gold received from money tokens, and the amount of bonus experience for completing a scenario are all dependent on the level of the scenario being played. The scenario level is chosen by the players before the scenario begins and is based on the average level of the party and how difficult the players want the scenario to be.\r\nA scenario's level can be set to any number from 0 to 7, but cannot be changed once the scenario begins. The recommended scenario level is equal to the average level of the characters in the party, divided by 2 and rounded up; this would be considered \"Normal\" difficulty. If players desire an \"Easy\" experience, they can reduce the recommended scenario level by 1. If a more difficult experience is desired, the scenario level can be raised by 1 for \"Hard\" or 2 for \"Very Hard.\"Example: If a party contains a Level 6 character, two Level 4 characters, and a Level 3 character, the average would be 4.25; divided by 2 and rounded up is 3, so a normal scenario difficulty level would be 3. The choice of scenario level is completely up to the players. Higher scenario levels will result in more difficult monsters, but will also yield more gold and experience.16Round OverviewA scenario consists of a series of rounds that are played until players either meet the victory conditions of the scenario or fail the scenario. A round consists of the following steps:1.\t Card selection: Each player will either select two cards from his or her hand to play or declare he or she is performing a long rest action for the round.\r\n2.\t Determining initiative: Players reveal their cards for the round, and an ability card for each monster type currently in play is also revealed. An initiative order is then determined based on the initiative values of these revealed cards.\r\n3.\t Character and monster turns: Starting with the lowest initiative, players and monsters will act out their turns, performing the actions on their cards, possibly modified by character item cards.\r\n4.\t Cleanup: Some cleanup may be required at the end of the round (see End of Round on p. 32 for details).Card SelectionAt the beginning of a round, each player will secretly select two cards from his or her hand to play facedown in front of them. Of the two cards, one should be selected as the leading card, which will determine the player's order in the initiative for the round (see Determining Initiative on p. 18 for details).Game Variant: Open Information and Solo PlayA single player can play the game as a solo experience by controlling two or more characters at once. Part of the game's difficulty, however, comes from not knowing exactly what the other characters will be doing on their turn. Because a solo player has precise information about what each character is doing and can coordinate more effectively, the game becomes easier.", "start_char_idx": 21855, "end_char_idx": 26465, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e57bfee2-83d1-4d75-b999-92cc415fab41": {"__data__": {"id_": "e57bfee2-83d1-4d75-b999-92cc415fab41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d48c514e-cf77-47ca-ba26-49995e02b071", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "fd75246be22b0430a0d61f219690bb638e8e47658273ebaa8b2ba65319298699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e3027a7-0e8c-44dc-a3e1-ec9ede2ef30d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "5cc3f55deff35e1bf82bce9fbf4cbf6ac7c81ff6f3341018e87d7c8b935eb378", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6fe6dc2-8cbc-4d25-b406-c1ae697b1b47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "073da0f6b9361820ec7ac25b73eb07b6494e2aab50316d588390c41e8881e595", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4.\t Cleanup: Some cleanup may be required at the end of the round (see End of Round on p. 32 for details).Card SelectionAt the beginning of a round, each player will secretly select two cards from his or her hand to play facedown in front of them.

Part of the game's difficulty, however, comes from not knowing exactly what the other characters will be doing on their turn. Because a solo player has precise information about what each character is doing and can coordinate more effectively, the game becomes easier. To compensate for this, solo players should increase the monster level and trap damage by 1 for any given scenario without increasing gold conversion and bonus experience.\r\nAdditionally, if they wish, a group of players may also play with fully open information by increasing the difficulty in the same way as for solo play. Playing with open information means that players can share the exact contents of their hands and discuss specific details about what they plan on doing. This is not the recommended way to play the game, but it may be desirable for certain groups.\r\nDuring a player's turn, the two played cards will be used to perform actions and then are either discarded, lost, or activated, depending on the actions that were taken. Played cards are normally placed in a player's discard pile unless otherwise noted. Discarded cards can be returned to a player's hand through resting (see below). If the performed action from a card contains a  symbol in the lower right of the action field, the card is instead placed in a player's lost pile. Lost cards can only be returned to a player's hand during a scenario by using a special recover action. Whether the corresponding card is lost or discarded, some actions may contain an active effect (denoted by the symbols at right). Instead of being placed in the discard or lost pile, the card is placed in the active area in front of the player to keep track of the effect. Once the effect wears off, the card is then transferred to the appropriate pile (see Active Bonuses on pp. 25-26 for details).Players must either play two cards from their hand or declare a long rest action at the beginning of every round. If a player only has one card or no cards in their hand, the long rest action is their only option. If this option is also not available at the beginning of a round because a player has only one card or no cards in their discard pile as well, that player is considered exhausted and can no longer participate in the scenario (see Exhaustion on p. 28 for details).\r\nRESTING*\tShort rest: During the cleanup step of a round, a player can perform a short rest. This allows that player to immediately shuffle his or her discard pile and randomly place one of the cards in the lost pile, then return the rest of the discarded cards to his or her hand. If the player would like to instead keep the card that was randomly lost, he or she can choose to suffer 1 damage and randomly lose a different discarded card, but this can only be done once per rest.\r\n*\tLong rest: A long rest is declared during the card selection step of a round and constitutes the player's entire turn for the round. Resting players are considered to have an initiative value of 99. On the player's turn, at the end of the initiative order, he or she must choose to lose one of his or her discarded cards, then return the rest of the discarded cards to his or her hand. The resting character also performs a \"Heal  2, Self\" action and refreshes all of his or her spent item cards.Players should not show other players the cards in their hands nor give specific information about any numerical value or title on any of their cards. They are, however, allowed to make general statements about their actions for the round and discuss strategy.*\tExamples of appropriate communication: \"I'm attacking this guard near the middle of the round.\"; \"I'm planning on moving here and healing you pretty early in the round, hopefully before the monsters attack.\"\r\n*\tExamples of inappropriate communication: \"You'll need lower than an initiative 17 to go before me.\"; \"I should be doing 4 points of damage to the bandit, so you don't have to worry about him.\"; \"I'm going to use Impaling Eruption and wipe out everyone.\"\r\nResting is the main way players can return discarded cards back into their hand of available cards.", "start_char_idx": 25619, "end_char_idx": 30310, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6fe6dc2-8cbc-4d25-b406-c1ae697b1b47": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6fe6dc2-8cbc-4d25-b406-c1ae697b1b47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d48c514e-cf77-47ca-ba26-49995e02b071", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "fd75246be22b0430a0d61f219690bb638e8e47658273ebaa8b2ba65319298699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e57bfee2-83d1-4d75-b999-92cc415fab41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "6d8198de2b3bbcd682153f12faf46a3b69da7aa51f07b94e461323470563c752", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "20628b8e-6ea5-4772-a330-e865d7fffcfd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6bbdbca3b68a909f13247f16bf41ad05ad8f85277fe82ba420580be4d4f3947", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They are, however, allowed to make general statements about their actions for the round and discuss strategy.*\tExamples of appropriate communication: \"I'm attacking this guard near the middle of the round.\"; \"I'm planning on moving here and healing you pretty early in the round, hopefully before the monsters attack.\"\r\n*\tExamples of inappropriate communication: \"You'll need lower than an initiative 17 to go before me.\"; \"I should be doing 4 points of damage to the bandit, so you don't have to worry about him.\"; \"I'm going to use Impaling Eruption and wipe out everyone.\"\r\nResting is the main way players can return discarded cards back into their hand of available cards. A player has two options when resting: a short rest or a long rest. In both cases, the rest action can only be taken if a player has two or more cards in his or her discard pile, and a rest action always results in losing one of the discarded cards.LostRecoverPersistent BonusRound BonusActive Effects18Character TurnOn a character's turn, he or she will perform the top action of one of the two ability cards played and the bottom action of the other. The leading card designation used to determine initiative is no longer significant. Either card can be played first for its top or bottom action. When playing a card's action, the abilities of the action must be done in the order written and can't be interrupted by the action on the other card. As soon as the action of a card is completed, it is immediately placed in the appropriate area (discard pile, lost pile, or active area) before anything else happens. Players are typically free to choose not to perform any part of the action on their card, however, they must perform any part that will cause a negative effect (e.g., reduce hit points, lose cards, or cause a negative condition) on themselves or their allies. An ally is any figure that fights with a character. This term includes summoned figures, but does not include the character itself. Abilities cannot affect allies unless the card or rules specify otherwise.Players can also use any card they play as an \"Attack 2\" action on the top half or a \"Move 2\" action on the bottom. If a card is used this way, it is always discarded, regardless of what is printed on the card.  On their turn, before, during, or after performing their two actions, players can use any number of items they have equipped.Determining InitiativeAfter players have either selected their two action cards or declared a long rest, the players reveal a monster ability card for each type of monster that has at least one figure currently on the map. In addition, each player not taking a long rest reveals his or her selected cards for the round, placing their leading card on top so that its initiative value is visible.Initiative order is determined by comparing the initiative values on all played monster ability cards and all of the players' leading cards. Whoever has the lowest initiative value takes their turn first, then the next highest, and so on until every figure on the board has acted. When a monster type takes an action, each monster of that type will perform the actions listed on their played ability card, starting with elites and then normal monsters in ascending standee order. \r\nIf there is ever a tie in initiative between players, consult the non-leading card of each player to break the tie. (If there is still a tie, players should decide among themselves who goes first.) If there is a tie between a player and a monster type, the player goes first. If there is a tie between two monster types, the players decide which goes first.Example: At the start of the round, the Brute decides that he wishes to play the two cards shown. He also decides he wants to go late in the round, so he choses the \"61\" as his leading card. If he had wanted to go early, he could have chosen the \"15\" as the leading card. The Scoundrel reveals a leading card with \"86\" initiative, and the played Living Bones and Bandit Archer monster ability cards have \"45\" and \"32\" initiative respectively. The Bandit Archers activate first, then all of the Living Bones, then the Brute, and finally the Scoundrel. The next time you suff er damage this round, suff er no damage instead.

Figures (characters and monsters) can move through allies, but cannot move through enemies or obstacles. Traps and other terrain effects of hexes must be resolved when a figure enters them with normal movement. A figure cannot end its movement in the same hex as another figure. Figures can never move through walls.Some Move abilities are specified as a \"Jump.\" Move X (Jump) allows the character to ignore all figures and terrain effects during their movement. However, the last hex of a jump is still considered a normal movement, and so must obey the normal movement rules above.Some figures may also have the \"Flying\" special trait. This allows figures to completely ignore any figures and terrain tiles during any part of their movement, including the last hex, except that they still must end their movement in an unoccupied hex (no figures present). This includes forced movement like PUSH or PULL. If a figure loses its Flying trait while occupying an obstacle hex, it takes damage as if it had sprung a damage trap and then moves immediately to the nearest empty hex (no figures, tokens, or overlay tiles of any kind present except corridors, pressure plates, and open doors).Ranged attacks are accompanied by a \"Range Y\" value, which means any enemy within Y hexes can be targeted by the attack. Any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy gains Disadvantage against that target (see Advantage and Disadvantage on pp. 20-21 for details).\r\nMelee attacks have no accompanying range value and are considered to have a default \r\nrange of 1 hex, which means they typically target adjacent enemies.Line-of-sight: All ranged and melee attacks can only be performed against enemies within line-of-sight, which means that a line can be drawn from any corner of the attacker's hex to any corner of the defender's hex without touching any part of a wall (the line edge of a map tile or the entire area of any partial hex along the edge of a map tile, unless covered by an overlay tile). Only walls block line-of-sight. In addition, any ability which specifies a range can only be performed on a figure within line-of-sight. If a non-attack ability does not specify a range, then line-of-sight is not required. Also note that two hexes separated by a wall line are not considered adjacent, and range cannot be counted through walls.\r\nREVEALING A ROOM During any part of a character's movement, if they enter a tile with a closed door, flip the door tile to the opened side and immediately reveal the adjacent room on the other side of the door. The Scenario Book will then specify what monsters, money tokens, and special overlay tiles should be placed in the revealed room, based on the number of characters (including exhausted characters). Note that, as in scenario setup, the standee numbers of the monsters in the new room should be randomized when placed. It is possible to run out of specific types of monster standees when revealing a room. If this happens, place only the standees that are available, starting with the monsters closest to the revealing character.Once everything is placed in the new room, any present monster types without an action card should have one drawn for them now. Once the revealing character's turn ends, the initiative values of all monsters in the new room are reviewed, and any monster type that has a lower initiative value than the revealing character (i.e., they should have acted earlier in the round) must immediately act out their turn (in normal initiative order in case of multiple monster types in this situation). This ensures that all monsters revealed in the new room will always take a turn in the round in which they are revealed.An \"Attack X\" ability allows a character to do a base X amount of damage to an enemy within their range.", "start_char_idx": 33361, "end_char_idx": 38026, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0747c232-4b9b-4385-85dc-3dd68c5b0a87": {"__data__": {"id_": "0747c232-4b9b-4385-85dc-3dd68c5b0a87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d48c514e-cf77-47ca-ba26-49995e02b071", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "fd75246be22b0430a0d61f219690bb638e8e47658273ebaa8b2ba65319298699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20628b8e-6ea5-4772-a330-e865d7fffcfd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "f14ee336319311bbc9829339e30768e05da6c0530bb6b86f1b9e7a771d824f02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e5a0b1ad-b04a-4de0-8f18-b80c7e88b8de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8278c62a45f957d67f3f7d5aaaafb862dfb593633e863baef61029cce8a609c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is possible to run out of specific types of monster standees when revealing a room.

Figures cannot attack their allies. There are two types of attacks: ranged and melee.20ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGESome attacks may have either Advantage or Disadvantage.*\tAn attacker with Advantage will draw two modifier cards from their deck and use whichever one is better  . If one rolling modifier card was drawn, its effect is added to the other card played  . If two rolling modifier cards were drawn, continue to draw cards until a rolling modifier is not drawn and then add together all drawn effects  .\r\n*\tAn attacker with Disadvantage will draw two modifier cards from their deck and use whichever one is worse  . Rolling modifiers are disregarded in the case of Disadvantage  . If two rolling modifier cards were drawn, continue to draw cards until a rolling modifier is not played and then only apply the effect of the last card drawn  . \r\n+++When attacking, the base attack value written on the card can be modified by three types of values in the following order. Repeat these steps for each individual enemy targeted by the attack:\r\n*\tAn attacker's attack modifiers are applied first. These modifiers include bonuses and penalties from active ability cards, items, and other sources (e.g., +1 Attack from POISON).\r\n*\tNext, an attack modifier card is drawn from the attacker's attack modifier deck and applied.\r\n*\tLastly, the defender's defensive bonuses are applied. This reduces the incoming attack value for each individual enemy targeted based on each defender's own shield modifier or other defensive bonuses.\r\n*\tIf there are multiple modifiers in any single step of this process, the player chooses the order in which they are applied. Also note that because the bonuses are applied per target, it is possible for the same attack action to ultimately deal different damage to each enemy it targets.\r\nExample: The Scoundrel performs an \"Attack 3\" ability on an adjacent elite Bandit Guard. The Scoundrel adds a +2 attack modifier because of specific conditions set by the card and also is allowed to double the attack because of an active card in front of her. She chooses to add the +2, then doubles the result, resulting in an \"Attack 10.\" She then plays an attack modifier card to reveal a \"-1,\" so the attack is reduced to 9. Finally, the Bandit Guard has a shield value of 1, so the attack value is reduced to 8 and the bandit suffers 8 damage.Any damage suffered by a monster should be tracked on the stat sleeve in the section corresponding to the number on the specific monster's standee. When a monster is brought to zero or fewer hit points by an attack or any source of damage, that monster immediately dies and is removed from the board. Any additional effects of an attack are not applied once a monster dies.When a monster dies, a money token is also placed on the hex where it died if the monster was not summoned or spawned. During your attack, gain Advantage on the entire Attack action.Eagle-Eye Goggles30759Example of an ability giving Advantage. Some attacks and other abilities allow figures to target multiple hexes or multiple targets at the same time. In these cases, the area of effect for the ability is shown on the ability card. Note that any rotational orientation of the depicted diagram is valid. Also note that each target constitutes a separate attack (drawing its own attack modifier card), but all attacks together make up a single attack action.\r\nSome attacks are accompanied by a \"Target X\" value, which means the character can target X number of different enemies within the attack's range with the attack.If there is ambiguity about which card drawn is better or worse, use whichever card was drawn first.

Ambiguity can occur when comparing one or more added effects provided by attack modifier cards (e.g., elemental infusions, negative conditions, etc.) All added effects should be considered to have a positive but undefined numerical value.Instances of Advantage and Disadvantage are mostly gained by specific character or monster abilities. However, any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy also gains Disadvantage for that target. Instances of Advantage or Disadvantage don't stack, and if an attack has instances of both Advantage and Disadvantage, they cancel out each other and the attack is performed normally.Move 4 Attack 4 Range 3 Gain for each enemy targeted. Affect self and all adjacent allies. Example: This attack indicates that the figure can perform a ranged \"Attack 4\" on a cluster of three hexes as long as at least one of those hexes is within Range 3.Example: This attack indicates that the figure can perform a melee \"Attack 3\" on the cluster of three hexes.\r\nGrey indicates the hex on which the figure is currently located. An area attack which includes a grey hex is always considered a melee attack.\r\nRed indicates the hexes with enemies affected by the ability.\r\nFor a ranged area attack, only one of the red hexes needs to be within the range specified, and it does not need to contain an enemy. However, for both ranged and melee area attacks, you can only attack enemies in hexes you have line of sight to.For any attack that targets multiple enemies, an attack modifier card is drawn for each target. It is not possible to target the same enemy with multiple attacks from the same ability. Note: Abilities can never target allies (positive abilities meant for allies will use the term \"affect\" instead of \"target\"). An ally can be within the affected area of an attack, but they will not be targeted by it.\r\nNote also that as long as an attack does not specify range, it is considered melee, such that it is possible to attack a non-adjacent target with a melee attack if hex configuration allows.\r\nATTACK EFFECTS: Attack abilities will often have effects that increase their power. If an attack effect is listed on an ability card after an attack, the target (or targets) of the attack is subject to the additional effect as well, after damage from the attack is resolved. Attack effects are applied regardless of whether the corresponding attack does damage. These effects (except experience gains) are optional and can be skipped. Some character actions can also apply these effects without an attack, and in such cases the target of the effect is written on the ability card. PUSH X - The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each hex moved must place the target farther away from the attacker than it was previously. If there are no viable hexes into which to push the target, the push ends. The target can be pushed through its allies, but not its enemies.\r\nPULL X - The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each hex moved must place the target closer to the attacker than it was previously. If there are no viable hexes into which to pull the target, the pull ends. The target can be pulled through its allies, but not its enemies. Both push and pull effects are considered movements, however, they are not affected by difficult terrain.\r\nPIERCE X - Up to X points of the target's Shield are ignored for the attack. Unlike other effects, PIERCE is applied while calculating the accompanying attack damage instead of afterwards.\r\nExample: an Attack 3 PIERCE 2 ability used on a monster with Shield 3 would ignore two of the monster's Shield points and inflict 2 damage (modified by an attack modifier card).ADD TARGET - If a figure triggers this effect with an attack action, the figure may add an additional target within range to their attack.", "start_char_idx": 40886, "end_char_idx": 45557, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec63b304-4b53-4dfd-a8a1-b35615650be4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec63b304-4b53-4dfd-a8a1-b35615650be4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d48c514e-cf77-47ca-ba26-49995e02b071", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "fd75246be22b0430a0d61f219690bb638e8e47658273ebaa8b2ba65319298699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5a0b1ad-b04a-4de0-8f18-b80c7e88b8de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "94f75b7e16724135bd377d19abd7e70d6a3700d0579b9444d709c41ffb4edcf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "89e2990e-d266-451f-82e8-931e1097df5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6dd8e6656944362b866b694ec9d95e0656881b3368997bebdd1da86f19fb549a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If there are no viable hexes into which to pull the target, the pull ends.

All added effects and conditions of the attack action are applied to the target, as well, except for effects that would result in additional targets outside of the original added target (e.g., area attacks).  POISON - If a figure is poisoned, all enemies add +1 Attack to all of their attacks targeting the figure. If a Heal ability is used on a poisoned figure, the POISON token is removed, and the Heal has no other effect.\r\nWOUND - If a figure is wounded, it suffers one point of damage at the start of each of its turns. If a Heal ability is used on a wounded figure, the WOUND token is removed and the Heal continues normally. If a figure is both poisoned and wounded, a Heal ability would remove both conditions but have no other effect.\r\nIMMOBILIZE - If a figure is immobilized, it cannot perform any move abilities on its turn.

When a condition is applied to a figure (except CURSE and BLESS), the respective token is placed on the stat sleeve in the section corresponding the number on the specific monster's standee to signify the effect. The condition remains on the figure until the requirements for removing the specific effect are met. Only one of each condition type may be applied to any single figure at a time, however conditions can be reapplied to refresh their duration.The following are negative conditions. If an ability has the name of one of these conditions contained within it, then the condition is applied to all targets of the ability, after the main effect of the ability is applied. Conditions are applied regardless of whether the corresponding attack does damage.23CURSE - If a figure is cursed, it must shuffle a CURSE card into its remaining attack modifier deck. When this card is revealed through one of the figure's attacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack modifier discard pile. Note that there are two separate curse decks: 10 cards with a  in the lower left corner and 10 cards with an  .   cards can only be placed in the monster attack deck (when a monster is cursed), and  cards can only be placed in a character's attack deck (when a character or character summon is cursed). Thus, a maximum of only 10 curse cards can be placed into any one deck.\r\nINVISIBLE - If a figure is invisible, it cannot be focused on or targeted by an enemy. Invisibility does not affect a figure's interactions with his or her allies. At the end of its next turn, the INVISIBLE token is removed. Monsters treat invisible characters exactly as if they were obstacles.\r\nSTRENGTHEN - If a figure is strengthened, it gains Advantage on all of its attacks. At the end of its next turn, the STRENGTHEN token is removed.\r\nDISARM - If a figure is disarmed, it cannot perform any attack abilities on its turn.

When this card is revealed through one of the figure's attacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack modifier discard pile.\r\nELEMENTAL INFUSIONS: Some abilities have an elemental affinity associated with them (either Fire, Ice, Air, Earth, Light, or Dark). If any of these symbols is visible by itself in an action's description  , it means that by performing any part of the action, the figure must infuse the battlefield with that element. This is represented by moving the corresponding element's token to the \"Strong\" column of the elemental infusion table at the end of the turn in which the ability was used.The following are positive conditions. Figures can apply positive conditions to themselves or allies through specific actions. Positive conditions cannot be prematurely removed.\r\nFire Orbs: At the end of every round, however, all elemental infusions will wane, moving one step to the left in the table, from \"Strong\" to \"Waning\" or from \"Waning\" to \"Inert.\"Elemental infusions can be used to augment the effects of certain abilities. This augment is represented by an elemental symbol covered with a red    , followed by a colon and how the ability is augmented if the element is consumed. If an ability is used that consumes an element and the corresponding element token is in the Strong or Waning column, that element token may be used to augment the ability by moving the token to the Inert column. A single icon cannot be used to consume more than one infusion, and it is not possible to create an element and consume it on the same turn, but it may be consumed by anyone with a later turn in the initiative order of the same round. If an ability contains multiple separate augments, the player may choose which augments to use in any order. If a single augment lists multiple element uses, all elements must be used to activate the augment.Just like characters, monsters also have the ability to create and consume elements. Monsters always consume elements if they can, and every activated monster of that type will gain the benefit of the consumed element, not just the first monster to consume it. \r\nThis multi-colored circle represents any single one of the six elements. If this symbol is present on a monster's ability card, the players choose which element is created or consumed. WOUND: Example: The Spellweaver plays her Frost Armor ability, which negates the next two sources of damage against her. She places a character token on the first circle of the card  . Then each time afterward that she normally would suffer 1 or more points of damage, the bonus is applied, the damage is negated, and the token is moved forward one space. Once the token moves twice, the card is moved to the player's lost pile and the bonus is no longer active.\r\nACTIVE BONUSES: Some abilities can give a character, or his or her allies, bonuses on other abilities, either persistently until certain conditions are fulfilled or for the rest of the round. These abilities are denoted with symbols, and the cards with these effects are played into the active area in front of the player to keep track of these bonuses.Persistent bonuses can be identified by the symbol   displayed on the card. These ability effects will be active from the time the card is played until the conditions specified on the card are met. These conditions usually track the number of times a particular game event has occurred, such as making or defending against an attack. Place a token on the first marked position of the card's action and advance it one space each time the effect is triggered, left to right, top to bottom.

The effect of the ability will be active from the time the card is played until the end of the round, at which point the card will be placed in the player's discard or lost pile (depending on whether the action also contains an  symbol).Even though a bonus card is placed in the active area, it is still considered discarded or lost, depending on whether the action also contains an   symbol. At any time, these cards can be moved to the appropriate pile, however, doing so immediately removes any bonuses that were being applied by the card.SHIELDA \"Shield X\" bonus ability gives the recipient a defender's bonus that reduces any incoming attack value by X. Multiple shield bonuses stack with one another and can be applied in any order. A shield bonus only applies to damage caused by an attack.On the next two sources of damageto you, suff er no damage instead. \r\nSUMMONS: Some abilities summon other ally figures to the board. Summoned figures (summons) are placed in an empty hex adjacent to the figure performing the summon. If there are no available hexes, the summon ability cannot be used. Summons are represented by a colored summon token. There are eight different colors of summon tokens so that multiple summons can be tracked at the same time, and players can assign any color they like to a specific summon, placing tracker tokens on their summon ability cards for easy reference. Summons have basic statistics for hit points, attack value, move value, and range value along with any special traits written on the ability card. A summon is considered a persistent bonus (the card is placed in the active area) until either the summon loses all its hit points, its corresponding ability card is removed from the active area, or the summoner becomes exhausted, at which point the summon is removed from the board. A summon's turn in the initiative order is always directly before the character who summoned it, and is separate from that character's turn. Summons are not controlled by the summoning player, but instead obey automated monster rules, permanently following the ability card \"Move+0, Attack+0\" (see Monster Turn on pp. 29-32 for details) and using the player's attack modifier deck to perform its attacks. A player can have multiple different summon abilities in play at once, in which case they act in the order in which they were summoned. Summoned figures never take a turn in the round they are summoned. Summon kills are credited to the owner of the summon.A \"Retaliate X\" bonus ability causes the recipient to inflict X points of damage on figures who attack it from an adjacent hex for each attack made. A retaliate bonus can also be accompanied by a \"Range Y\" value, which means that the retaliate damage is applied to any attacker within Y hexes. A retaliate takes effect after the attack that initiated it. If the retaliating figure is killed or exhausted by the attack, then the retaliate does not activate. Multiple retaliate bonuses stack with one another, and retaliate itself is not an attack or even a targeted effect.A \"Heal X\" ability allows a figure to return X hit points to either themselves or one ally within the ability's range.  Heals are always accompanied by one of two labels:\r\n*\t \"Range Y\" means that any ally within Y hexes, or the figure performing the heal, can be affected by the heal.

This means that the player can look through his or her discard or lost pile (or discarded or lost cards in his or her active area), select up to a number of cards specified in the ability, and immediately return them to his or her hand. Some cards, however, cannot be recovered or refreshed once lost. This is denoted by the   symbol. This symbol applies to the card no matter how the card was lost or consumed.Refresh abilities allow players to regain the use of spent or consumed item cards. In the case of both recover and refresh, the type of card gained (discarded or lost for ability cards, spent or consumed for item cards) is specified in the ability.LOOTA \"Loot X\" ability allows a character to pick up every money token and treasure tile within range X. This action is unaffected by the positions of monsters or obstacles, but note this is considered a ranged ability for the purposes of line-of-sight. Money tokens are kept in a player's personal supply and are not shared with the other players. If a treasure tile is looted, immediately refer to the reference number in the treasure index in the back of the scenario book to determine what is found (see Treasure on p. 15 for details). If a character loots an item he or she already owns a copy of, the new item is immediately sold to the city's available supply (see Buying and Selling Items on p. 43 for details).Some actions also have an experience value attached to them, denoted by  . When that action is taken, the character gains the number of experience specified. An ability card cannot be played for the experience alone--a character must use one or more of the accompanying abilities to earn the experience. In addition, sometimes the action specifies that experience is only earned under certain conditions, such as consuming an elemental infusion or if the attacked target is adjacent to an attacker's allies  . Some persistent bonuses will also give a character experience, denoted by  , when that charge of the bonus is expended   (i.e., when the character token moves off that slot). Characters do not automatically gain experience from killing monsters. Only using specific actions awards experience.END-OF-TURN LOOTINGIn addition to specific loot abilities, a character must also loot any money tokens or treasure tiles present in the hex he or she occupies at the end of the character's turn.

They are not controlled by a separate player. All monsters will perform the actions listed on their ability card for the round in the order written. They will not move or attack unless these actions are listed on their card.Note that each type of monster can come in two ranks: normal and elite. Normal monsters are designated with a white stand and elite monsters are designated with a gold stand. When an elite monster acts, use the statistics in the \"Elite\" section of the monster statistic card.\r\nORDER OF ACTION: All monsters of the same type take individual turns at the same initiative value listed on their monster ability card. All elites of a type activate first, then the normal monsters of that type activate. If more than one elite or normal monster of a given type is present on the board, then the monsters activate in ascending numerical order according to the numbers on their tokens  .\r\nExample: With the setup to the left, the elite monster to the right  will activate first, then the other elite  . Next the normal monster on the top will activate  , then the lower monster  .

It finds the shortest possible path to get in range and line-of-sight to use its attack, and the figure that can be attacked at the end of that path is the focus. This enemy figure is considered the \"closest.\" It doesn't matter if the monster can't get within range to attack with its current movement, as long as there is a path to eventually get within range. If a monster does not have an attack listed on its ability card for the round, it finds a focus as if it had a melee attack. In the case where the monster can move the same number of spaces to get within range (and line-of-sight) of multiple enemy figures (e.g., because it starts its turn within range of multiple enemies), proximity from the monster's current position (i.e. number of hexes they are away, not counting through walls) is then checked as a tie-breaker for determining \"closest.\"\r\nIn addition to determining order of action, the number on the monster standee  corresponds to a section of the monster stat sleeve  that can be used to track damage and condition tokens.\r\nMonster Turn *\tIf more than one enemy ties for being the closest, the second priority is to focus on the enemy who is earlier in the initiative order (summons are focused on before the character who summoned them in this regard, even on the round they are summoned, and a character who is performing a long rest would be focused on last).\r\nMONSTER MOVEMENT:\r\nA monster can move on its turn if \"Move+-X\" is part of its ability card. It can move up to a number of hexes equal to its base move value (found on its monster statistic card) modified by X (either positive or negative).If a monster has a move but no attack afterward as part of its ability card, it will use its movement to get as close as possible to its focused target (determined as if it had a melee attack), moving along the shortest possible path to enter a hex adjacent to its focused enemy.If a monster has an attack ability after its movement, it will move the least number of hexes possible in such a way as to attack its focused enemy with maximum effect. If it is a single-target melee attack, it will simply move toward the nearest hex adjacent to its focus to attack. If it is a multi-target attack, it will move toward a position where its attack will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible.If the monster is performing a ranged attack, it will only move toward a hex where it is within range to perform its best possible attack. A monster will also move away from its focused enemy until it can perform the ranged attack without Disadvantage. When forced to choose, a monster will prioritize losing Disadvantage on its focused enemy over maximizing its attack on secondary targets. Even if a monster cannot move into attack range, it will still use its movement to get as close as possible to its focus.Having abilities other than \"Attack\" on its ability card does not affect a monster's movement in any way. It will simply move according to the above rules and then use its other abilities as best as it can.Example: Monster  can perform a \"Move 3\" ability. It first focuses on the Brute  , since he is the closest enemy. If the monster had a ranged attack, it would remain in its current hex and attack the Brute. If it had a single-target melee attack, it would move 1 hex  to be adjacent to the Brute and attack.

If it had a single-target melee attack, it would move 1 hex  to be adjacent to the Brute and attack. If it could attack two targets with a melee attack, it would move 2 hexes  to be adjacent to both the Brute and the Tinkerer. If it could melee attack three or more targets, it would move 3 hexes  to be adjacent to all three characters.Example: Even though the Brute  is physically closer to Monster  , the monster is performing a melee attack and can get in range of the Tinkerer in fewer steps (2 instead of 4), so the monster focuses on the Tinkerer  .In the case where there are no valid targets on which to focus, because there are no valid hexes a monster can attack from (i.e., they are all blocked, occupied, or there is no open path to reach them), regardless of the number of hexes it could move, a monster will not move or attack on its turn, but it will perform any of the other actions on its ability card that it is able.\r\nMONSTER INTERACTION WITH TRAPS AND HAZARDOUS TERRAIN: Monsters without the Flying trait consider negative hexes (traps or hazardous terrain) to be obstacles when determining focus and movement unless movement through one of these hexes is the only way they can focus on a target. In this case, they will use the path moving through the smallest number of negative hexes possible to find a focus and suffer any consequences.Example: Even though the Tinkerer   is closer, Monster  will focus on the Brute  with its melee attack because it considers traps to be obstacles. Only if the Brute were not there and the only enemy the monster could focus on was the Tinkerer would it do so and cross the traps to get to him.MONSTER ATTACKSA monster will attack on its turn if \"Attack+-X\" is part of its ability card. Any damage dealt is calculated from its base attack value (found on its monster statistic card) modified by X (either positive or negative). Monsters will always attack their focused enemies (see Monster Focus on pp. 29-30 for details) but if the monster can attack multiple targets, it will attack its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible to maximum effect. If a monster has multiple attacks, it will choose the focus of its other attacks following normal focus rules, excluding figures it is already attacking. Any attack that does not specify a range on the monster ability card should use the base range of the monster written on its stat card.Monster attacks function exactly like character attacks, and are modified by the attacker's attack bonuses, then attack modifier cards, then the defense bonuses of their target. They may be performed with Advantage or Disadvantage as discussed on pp. 20-21.\r\nOTHER MONSTER ABILITIESHealing: Monster healing functions exactly like character healing as discussed on p. 26. With a \"Heal X\" ability, the monster will heal themselves or an ally within the specified range, whichever has lost the most hit points.Summons: Monster summon abilities place new monsters on the board that behave exactly like the normal monsters, acting according to played monster ability cards of their type. Summoned monsters are placed in an empty hex adjacent to the summoning monster and also as close to an enemy as possible. If there are no empty adjacent hexes or there are no available standees of the summoned monster type, the summon fails. Summoned monsters never act on the round they are summoned, nor do they drop money tokens when killed.Example: Archer  will focus on the Brute  , since she can get in range to attack him with the least number of moves. If the archer has a Range 3 attack and Move 2, she will move to hex  and attack her focus. If she only has Move 1, however, she will stay where she is and not attack.

In these cases, a monster will pick up all money tokens within the specified range. These money tokens are lost and are not dropped again when the looting monster is killed. Monsters are unable to loot treasure tiles.AMBIGUITYIf the rules ever make any monster action ambiguous because there are multiple viable hexes to which the monster could move, multiple equally viable targets to heal or attack, or multiple hexes a monster could push or pull a character into, the players must decide which option the monster will take.BOSSESEnd of RoundOnce all figures have taken a turn, the round ends and some cleanup steps may be necessary:*\tIf a standard \"2x\"    or \"Null\"    attack modifier card was drawn from a specific modifier deck during the round, shuffle all the discards of that deck back into its draw deck.\r\n*\tIf a monster ability card with a shuffle symbol   was drawn at the start of the round, shuffle all discards for the corresponding monster type back into its deck.\r\n*\tIf there are any elemental infusion tokens in the Strong column, move them to the Waning column. If there are any elemental infusion tokens in the Waning column, move them to Inert.\r\n*\tPlace all active round bonus ability cards in the appropriate discard or lost pile (depending on whether an action with a [lost card] symbol was used).\r\n*\tPlayers may also perform a short rest (see Resting on p. 17 for details) if they are able.Players will occasionally encounter bosses in their adventures. All bosses have their own stat card but act using a universal \"Boss\" ability card deck  . Note that bosses are not considered normal or elite monsters. Bosses perform special actions on their turn that are summarized on their stat card. Explanations for more complicated abilities can be found in the Scenario Book. Bosses' stats are often based on the number of characters, which is signified by the letter \"C\" on the boss stat card. Lastly, bosses are immune to certain negative conditions. The conditions to which they are immune are listed on their stat card  .\r\nROUND TRACKER: Some scenarios may require players to keep track of what round it is. A round track can be found at the top of the elemental infusion table for this purpose. At the end of every round, simply move the tracker token   forward one space. Note that it is not necessary to keep track of the rounds for most scenarios. Finishing a ScenarioA scenario can end in one of two ways: success or failure. Once a scenario's success or failure conditions are triggered, the remainder of the round is played out, and then the scenario ends.Success or failure, players tally the experience their individual characters earned during the scenario and tally the money tokens their characters looted during the scenario and convert them into gold. Each money token looted is worth an amount of gold based on the scenario level and specified on the chart on p. 15. Anything not looted during the scenario is not collected. Players also recover all lost and discarded ability cards, refresh all spent and exhausted item cards, and return their hit point dials to their maximum hit point value so that they can start fresh in a future scenario.

All battle goals are shuffled back into the battle goal deck, regardless of whether they were completed.If players successfully complete the scenario, they receive checkmarks for their characters' completed battle goal cards at this time. Checkmarks are recorded on the player's character sheet and completing a set of three immediately earns a character an additional perk (see Additional Perks on p. 44 for details). Even if a character is exhausted, as long as the scenario was successfully completed, that character can still complete his or her battle goal, earn scenario rewards, and keep all the money and experience he or she collected before becoming exhausted. There is no penalty for becoming exhausted. Players also receive bonus experience for successfully completing the scenario. This bonus is equal to four plus twice the scenario level (see Scenario Level on p. 15 for details).If players are playing in a campaign, successfully completing a scenario will also allow them to read the conclusion flavor text of the scenario and gain the benefits listed at the end (see Scenario Completion on p. 49 for details). In a campaign the money and experience collected during a scenario will be very important to improve a character's skills and abilities and should be tracked on the player's character sheet  . If the scenario was not part of a campaign, money and experience can be used as metric for gauging how well each character did. \r\nCampaign Overview: There are two ways to play Gloomhaven: campaign mode and casual mode.In campaign mode, players will form an official party of characters and undertake a number of consecutive scenarios over multiple play sessions. This allows players to follow a story thread as they make decisions and explore a path of their own choosing. A scenario can only be played in campaign mode if all the prerequisite global and party achievements listed as required in the Scenario Book are active for the party. In addition, once a scenario has been completed in campaign mode, it cannot be undertaken again in campaign mode by any party.In casual mode, players can play any revealed scenario on the world map regardless of achievements or whether it has been completed in campaign mode. Players can still gain experience and money, loot treasure tiles, complete battle goals, and make progress toward completing their personal quests, but any story text or rewards listed at the end of the scenario are disregarded. A party in campaign mode can switch to casual mode to go through a scenario they have already completed, but it is strongly recommended that a party not undertake a scenario in casual mode that they haven't yet experienced in campaign mode.The rules that follow will deal specifically with playing the game in campaign mode.Special Scenario RulesMany scenarios will feature extra rules. The following are clarifications for common special scenario rules:*\t Spawning: When a monster is spawned, it is set up on the map at its spawning location or the nearest empty hex to that location. If a monster is spawned at the end of a round, it will begin to activate on the following round. If a monster is spawned during a round, it activates as if it had just been revealed (see     Revealing a Room on p. 19 for details).\r\n*\t Locked doors: Some doors are classified as \"locked,\" which means they cannot be opened by a character moving onto them.

These obstacles are considered enemies for all ability purposes and have an initiative of 99 for the purpose of summon focusing, but they are immune to all negative conditions.\r\n*\t Objective and scenario aid tokens: Objective tokens  are used in many scenarios to represent allied figures or loot locations. In the case of allied figures, the numbers on the tokens should be randomized when placed, with the numbers determining the figures' activation order. Scenario aid tokens  can be placed on the map tiles to act as a reminder for special cases, such as where enemies spawn or when to read numbered sections from the scenario book.\r\n*\t Named monsters: Often times the goal of a scenario is to kill a specific monster, either a boss or a unique variant of a regular monster, as specified in the scenario rules. These monsters are not considered normal or elite and thus are not affected by character abilities that target only normal or elite monsters.\r\n*\t Equations: Some scenario properties such as hit points for obstacles or named monsters are determined by equations that depend on the scenario level and the number of characters. In such instances, \"L\" is used to denote the scenario level, and \"C\" is used to denote the number of characters.1abba35The campaign board is used to track the global progress of the game world. The locations, achievements, and prosperity tracked on the board apply globally to all parties playing in the world.THE BOARD INCLUDES:*\tA map of Gloomhaven  and the surrounding area  . Numbered circles on the map  represent scenarios that can be unlocked through the course of playing the campaign. When a scenario is unlocked, its corresponding sticker  is placed over the numbered circle (see Scenario Completion on p. 49 for details). When an unlocked scenario is completed in campaign mode, the blank spot on its sticker  is marked to signify this.\r\n*\tA reference grid for the map  so that scenario locations can more easily be found.\r\n*\tA space for tracking global achievements  . When a global achievement is unlocked, its corresponding sticker  should be placed in one of the sticker slots in this space (see Achievements on p. 40 for details).\r\n*\tA prosperity track  . When the prosperity of Gloomhaven increases, a square on the prosperity track should be marked for every point of increase, moving from left to right (see Gloomhaven Prosperity on p. 48 for details). At certain thresholds, this will increase the prosperity level of Gloomhaven.Campaign BoardabiehfcddgLocation stickerefhgiabcd36Party SheetA party is formed when a new group of players gets together to play the game.

These cards look very similar to normal item cards, but have a blue back, shown at the right. When a card is drawn, the player should find the one additional copy of the drawn item with the same reference number in the deck of unavailable items and add both cards to the city's available supply of items. It is possible to deplete the random item design deck. In this case, additional random item design rewards have no effect.Random Side Scenario CardsWhenever a \"Random Side Scenario\" is listed as the reward when looting a treasure tile, the looting players should draw a card from the random side scenario deck.

City events and road events have different art and content, but they work the same way.AN EVENT CARD CONTAINS:\r\nresolved.\r\nWhen the game box is opened and the campaign begins, a shuffled city event deck and road event deck should both be created using city and road events 01 through 30. Players will be directed to add or remove certain events from these decks over the course of the campaign. When a card is added to an event deck, the event deck should then be shuffled. Note that adding a card is different from returning a played card to an event deck, in which case it is placed on the bottom of the deck and the deck is not shuffled.05After resting for the evening, you start out your day noticing a great number of prominent, command-ing posters around the city.Reading one, you learn that the Sanctuary of the Great Oak is laying down the foundation for a new building on the east side of Gloomhaven.

At certain times, the game will direct players to open one of these. If it contains materials for a new character class, that character class is now available for anyone starting a new character. If the envelope contains other contents, the contents will direct the players how to use them.Players will be directed to open boxes or envelopes when they complete personal quests or meet specific conditions. These conditions are listed on p. 49.Town RecordsAchievementsThe achievement system is the main way that players will keep track of major changes in the world and what scenarios a particular party has access to while playing in campaign mode. There are two types of achievements: global achievements and party achievements.Global achievements affect the entire game world, regardless of what party is playing in it. Global achievements are tracked with stickers along the top of the world map  . Some global achievements have a specific type (listed after the achievement in the format of \"Type: Achievement,\" e.g., \"City Rule: Militaristic\"). Only one global achievement of each type can be active at a time. If a global achievement is gained and there is already an active achievement of the same type, the previous achievement is overwritten and the new sticker is placed on top of the previous one. Multiple instances of a single global achievement are possible, so long they don't have a specific type.Party achievements are tied to a specific party and are mainly used to keep track of what scenarios are available to play in campaign mode for that party.The game box also includes a small sealed book titled \"Town Records.\" Players are directed to open this book once the first character retires, at which point they can begin reading the book from front to back. At certain points in the book, players will be directed to stop reading until certain conditions are met. Playing a CampaignTraveling and Road EventsIf players return to Gloomhaven, once they are finished with their business in town (see Visiting Gloomhaven on pp. 42-48 for details), then the party will still need to travel to a new scenario and complete a road event unless the new scenario is linked to Gloomhaven or it is being played in casual mode. This link will also be listed in the scenario's entry in the scenario book.Example: After completing the Black Barrow scenario, the party unlocks the Barrow Lair scenario.

Now when they travel to the Barrow Lair, they must complete a road event because the Barrow Lair is not linked to Gloomhaven.\r\nCOMPLETING ROAD EVENTS: To complete a road event, players draw a single card from the road event deck and read the introductory text on the front.

A choice should be read top to bottom, resolving all outcomes that apply to the party.After every scenario, whether it was a success or failure, players have the choice to either return to Gloomhaven or to immediately travel to a new scenario.In the case that players immediately travel to a new scenario, they must complete a road event before starting the new scenario unless they are playing the same scenario, the new scenario is linked to the previous scenario, or they are playing in casual mode.

Your target is not among the dead, and you shudder to think what horrors still await you in the catacombs below.  2Conclusion :Kicking through the door, you find yourself face-to-face with the reason these bandits chose this particular hole to nest in: animate bones--unholy abominations of necromantic power.Nothing more to do but lay them to rest along with the remainder of this troublesome bbl1The hill is easy enough to find--a short journey past the New Market Gate and you see it jutting out on the edge of the Corpsewood, looking like a rat under a rug. Moving closer you see the mound is formed from a black earth. Its small, overgrown entrance presents a worn set of stone stairs leading down into the darkness. As you descend, you gratefully notice light emanating from below. Unfortunately, the light is accompanied by the unmistakable stench of death. You contemplate what kind of thieves would make their camp in such a horrid place as you reach the bottom of the steps. Here you find your answer--a rough group of cutthroats who don't seem to have taken very kindly to your sudden appearance. One in the back matches the description of your quarry.\"Take care of these unfortunates,\" he says, backing out of the room. You can vaguely make out his silhouette as he retreats down a hallway and through a door to his left.\"Well, it's not every day we get people stupid enough to hand-deliver their valuables to us,\" grins one of the larger bandits, unsheathing a rusty blade. \"We'll be killing you now.\" Joke's on them.

A new visit to Gloomhaven can be triggered after every scenario played in campaign mode.CREATING NEW CHARACTERSThe first step in any character's story is creation. Players will create new characters when they first start playing the game, when they retire an old character and wish to continue playing, or pretty much whenever they want to try something new. When the box is first opened, the following six classes are available to play: Brute   , Tinkerer   , Spellweaver   , Scoundrel   , Cragheart   , and Mindthief   .When a player creates a new character, he or she gains access to that character's character mat and deck of Level 1 and \"X\" ability cards. The player should create a new entry in the class's corresponding character sheet notepad, and also draw two random personal quest cards, choosing to keep one and shuffling the other back into the deck. A player can start a character at any level equal to or lower than the prosperity level of the city (see Gloomhaven Prosperity on p. 48 for details). If a player starts a character above Level 1, they should go through all the steps outlined on p. 44 for each level increase in sequence, up to and including their chosen starting level. In addition, a newly created character receives an amount of gold equal to 15x(L+1), where L is their starting level. A character starts with an amount of experience equal to the minimum required for their level (the number listed below that level on the character sheet).REPUTATIONReputation is tied to a specific party and is tracked on the party sheet. Any time a new party is formed, that party starts at 0 reputation. Through event consequences or by completing certain scenarios, the party will gain or lose reputation. A party can have a maximum reputation of 20 and a minimum reputation of -20.A party's reputation has a number of implications:*\tMany events have consequences that are only applied if the party meets specific reputation requirements.\r\n*\tWhen buying items, players modify the cost based on their reputation. They receive a reduction in cost at a higher reputation and an increase in cost at a lower reputation. These cost modifications are written next to the reputation track on the party sheet.\r\n*\tCertain sealed envelopes are opened when a party reaches specific positive and negative values of reputation.\r\nCOMPLETING CITY EVENTSOnce per visit to Gloomhaven, a party may complete a city event. City events are functionally the same as road events, but are drawn from the city event deck and generally have better outcomes than road events.When in Gloomhaven, characters have the opportunity to buy item cards by spending the gold they've collected from scenarios. In addition, players can also sell back any item for half the price listed on the item card (rounded down). When an item is sold, it goes back into the city's available supply, and the character receives the calculated amount of gold. Players can own as many items as they can afford, but are limited in how many they can equip (see Item Cards on p. 8 for details). Players cannot trade money or items.When the game box is opened and the campaign begins, the city's available supply should consist of all copies of Item 001 through Item 014. Over the course of the campaign, many more items will be added to the city's available supply based on the following conditions:\r\n*\tAny time an item design is gained from a scenario or event, every copy of that item card is added to the city's available supply.\r\n*\tAs the city gains prosperity levels (see Gloomhaven Prosperity on p. 48 for details), new items will be made available in the supply. The list of what items are made available at each prosperity level can be found to the right.\r\n*\tLastly, when a character retires, all of their item cards go back into the shop's supply.", "start_char_idx": 100032, "end_char_idx": 104636, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6185c742-20db-4dc9-bf59-5bf3091bd9f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6185c742-20db-4dc9-bf59-5bf3091bd9f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d48c514e-cf77-47ca-ba26-49995e02b071", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "fd75246be22b0430a0d61f219690bb638e8e47658273ebaa8b2ba65319298699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "433bde93-08fd-42ee-8c8f-47dd17e87928", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "983e9c6cbed2a657a585d596202d5afcf5cd107ee13b4953e8acec25d4a548ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7dad76bb-1383-48d7-b39b-b01a35fac796", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0c5eadd1f5fa35802e0927ced80ac169e9f0720a1f12463b9802b3e05f486d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "8 for details).

The list of what items are made available at each prosperity level can be found to the right.\r\n*\tLastly, when a character retires, all of their item cards go back into the shop's supply.\r\nWithin any one party, the number of items available for purchase is limited by how many copies of the item's card there are. No character may own duplicates of the same item. If a different party plays the game with different characters, items possessed by unused characters are considered to be in the city's available supply and can be purchased. Players should always keep track of what items they own on their character sheets in case the cards get moved around by other groups.BUYING AND SELLING ITEMS2/4Minor Healing Potion10During your turn, perform a \"Heal      3, Self\" action.\r\nExample: The Brute marks the \"Replace one  card with one  card,\" so he removes a   card from his attack modifier deck and adds a   card (taken from his Brute modifier deck) in its place. \r\nADDITIONAL PERKS: Lastly, leveling up also increases a character's hit point total  , as indicated on their character mat.Leveling up never changes a character's maximum hand size. This is fixed for each class.Any time a character successfully completes a battle goal card at the end of a scenario, they receive a number of checkmarks, which are tracked in the specified area of the notes section of their character sheet. For every three checkmarks a character earns, he or she immediately gains an additional perk on their character sheet and applies its effects to their attack modifier deck. Any checkmarks from a battle goal that are left over after achieving a perk are applied toward the next perk. A character can achieve a total of six additional perks in this way.LEVELING UPWhen a character gains the amount of experience listed on the table to the right, they must level up. Leveling up only occurs in town.When a character reaches a new level, add one new card to their active card pool. The card selected must be from the character's class and have a card level equal to or less than the character's new level.Additionally, when leveling up, the player can mark one of the perk boxes on the right side of their character sheet. This signifies an evolution of the character's attack modifier deck.  Apply the bonuses of the marked perk box to the character's modifier deck using the class's accompanying deck of available modifier cards. If a perk has multiple check boxes next to it, this means that the perk can be gained multiple times for the cost of one perk each.\r\nGain 7 or fewer experience points during the scenario. BUILDING A HAND OF CARDS: When playing a class for the first time, it is recommended that players use a hand comprised entirely of Level 1 cards (denoted by a  below the title). However, each character also has immediate access to three  cards. These are typically more complex and situational than Level 1 cards. Once a player is familiar with the basic abilities of the class, they should consider incorporating one or more  cards into their hand, removing an equal number of Level 1 cards to observe the hand limit.As characters level up, higher level ability cards will also become available. Even though players have access to more cards, the maximum number of cards they can take into battle (hand limit) remains the same.

Doing so allows the donating player to add two BLESS    attack modifier cards to their attack modifier deck for the next scenario.Once players have completed \"The Power of Enhancement\" global achievement, they can spend gold while visiting Gloomhaven to increase the power of their ability cards. To do this, a player places the desired sticker from the enhancement sticker sheets onto a designated spot  of an ability card in their character's active card pool. This sticker denotes a permanent enhancement to the ability.ENHANCING ABILITY CARDSAbility cards can be enhanced in a variety of ways, with each costing a specific amount of gold. This cost must be paid by the character whose ability card is being enhanced. The base cost associated with any enhancement depends on the sticker and what ability the sticker is enhancing. Double the base cost of an enhancement (other than an attack hex) if it is applied to an ability that targets multiple figures. Additional costs are added based on the level of the ability card and the number of previously placed enhancement stickers on the same action.The total number of enhanced cards in a class's ability deck must be equal to or less than the prosperity level of the town. Once placed, enhancement stickers should never be removed. Enhancements persist through all instances of a specific character class, even after retirement.Can be placed on any ability line or summon base stat line with a numerical value. That value is increased by 1.Can be placed on any main ability line that targets enemies. The specified condition is applied to all targets of the ability.Can be placed on any main ability line that affects allies or yourself. A \"Move\" ability does not count as affecting yourself. The specified condition is applied to all targets of the ability.Can be placed on any \"Move\" ability line. The movement is now considered a jump.Can be placed on any main ability line. The element is created when the ability is used. In the case of a  the player chooses the element as normal.Can be placed to increase the graphical depiction of an area attack. The new hex becomes an additional target of the attack.Each kind of enhancement sticker has a different function and has restrictions on where it can be placed. \"Main line ability\" refers to an ability written in large font (as opposed to modifiers written in a smaller font under the main line):47Base  Enhancement Cost(For summons)Double base cost for any ability with multiple targets.Base Other Effects CostLevel of Ability CardNumber of Previous Enhancements.

The character may perform any other town activities beforehand, but he or she cannot play any new scenarios using a character with a fulfilled personal quest. The character has accomplished his or her dreams and has no more motivation to go exploring monster-filled ruins. All the materials for the character are returned to the box, any items the character owned are returned to the city's available supply, and all money the character owned is gone. Additionally, the city gains 1 prosperity. Fulfilling personal quests will always unlock new content for the game. They will allow the player to open a sealed box or envelope, which will usually unlock a new character class. Any time players are directed to open a box or envelope and it has already been opened because of some previous condition, a new random item design and random side scenario are unlocked instead (see p. 38 for details). When a personal quest is fulfilled, the personal quest card is removed from the game.Each time an individual player retires a character, that player also gains one extra perk to apply to all future characters they create. This effect is cumulative, so when a player retires their second character, his or her next character would gain two additional perks. Though this effect is applied to players, if one player is controlling multiple characters at once in a campaign (e.g., solo play), he or she considers each character lineage they control a different player for this bonus.When a specific character class retires for the first time, new city and road events are usually added to the events decks. The reference number for these is written on the back side of the class's character mat in the bottom right (rightmost number). In addition, whenever a new character class is unlocked through retirement or other means, new city and road events are also added to the decks. This reference number is on the back side of the unlocked class's character mat in the bottom right (leftmost number). Each reference number applies to both the city and road event decks.When a player's character retires, they can choose a new character to play, drawing two new personal quest cards, keeping one and discarding the other. Players are free to use the same class for their new character, but fulfilling personal quests usually unlocks a new class, encouraging players to explore new play styles over the course of the campaign. New characters may start at any level equal to or less than the current prosperity level of the town.It is possible to run out of available personal quest cards. If there are no personal quest cards left when a player creates a new character, then that character does not receive a personal quest. A character without a personal quest can never retire, though the player is still free to switch characters whenever he or she wishes.GLOOMHAVEN PROSPERITYAs the characters grow in power, the town of Gloomhaven grows in prosperity. Gloomhaven prosperity can be gained either through certain events or by completing certain scenarios. The prosperity points are tracked along the bottom of the map board  , and the town will attain new levels when reaching the designated thresholds.When the city reaches a new level of prosperity, players gain two benefits:*\tNew items become available for purchase, according to the chart on p. 43.\r\n*\tNew characters may begin at any level equal to or less than the prosperity level of the town.

Random dungeons will not progress the campaign in any way, but they can be used to gain additional experience, money, checkmarks, and personal quest progress for characters.Each random dungeon consists of three randomly generated rooms and the goal is always to clear all rooms of monsters. The three rooms will be set up one at a time, with the next room only being revealed once the door to it has been opened. Each room is set up using a room card and a monster card, each drawn randomly from the tops of their shuffled decks.*\t A noun title  . When combined with the adjective title on the monster card, this provides the full title of the room.\r\n*\t A graphical depiction of the map tile(s) used in the setup of the room along with twelve numerical designations of where various elements of the monster card are placed during setup  . The room setup will also depict any obstacle overlay tiles to be placed. It is possible to run out of specific overlay tiles when setting up the second or third room. In these cases, use a comparable overlay tile of the same type.\r\n*\t Designations for where players enter  or exit  the room and what types the entrance(s) and exit(s) are (see below for details). Entrances and exits always correspond to the nearest half-hex of the tile with a puzzle connection. If this is the first room of the dungeon, players can place their figure on any empty hex within two hexes of the entrance. If the first room has multiple entrances, players can collectively choose on which entrance to start.\r\nA ROOM CARD INCLUDES:A127110582116934AAATile: H1bMajor: MUDDLE  all characters permanently.Minor: MUDDLE  all characters.Sewer534fgcedababcd51*\tThe entrance type available for the room on the back of the card  .

If the entrance of the top room in the deck does not match the exit the players used inthe previous room, the top card is discarded until a matching entrance type is found.\r\n\r\nIf a room has two exits, players may use whichever one they wish, though the one they don't use is closedoff. If a room has two entrances, players must use the entrance that corresponds to the previous room'sexit.*\tPenalties for revealing the room  .

This effect is cumulative, so when a player retires their second character, their next character would gain two additional perks. Though this effect is applied to players, if one player is controlling multiple characters at once in a campaign (like for solo play, for instance), they should consider each \"hand\" they control a different player for this bonus. The \"b\" sides of the \"L\" and \"D\" tiles are misprinted and have their art rotated by 180 degrees in relation to their puzzle piece connections when compared to the images in the scenario book and random dungeon deck. When setting up these tiles, make sure their puzzle connection orientation is correct and don't use the art as a reference. Component count typos: The component list in the front of the rule book should say there are 28 \"1\" damage counters, 240 monster standees and 3 sealed envelopes. Also, there is no smaller envelope with a sun icon on it, as depicted in the picture. Typo in special conditions for opening envelopes: The second item should read \"The Drake's Command\" instead of \"The Drake's Request.\" When you achieve this goal, you earn \"The Drake Aided\" global achievement. Also, it is optional to open the envelope and earn the achievement, but once it is done, it is permanent. The curse deck is split into two equal decks of 10 cards each. One deck is exclusively for putting curse cards into the players' attack modifier decks, and the other is exclusively for putting curse cards into the monsters' attack modifier deck. So no single attack modifier deck can ever have more than 10 curse cards in it. When a curse card is removed from a player's attack modifier deck, it is returned to the player curse card deck, and a curse card removed from the monster attack modifier deck is returned to the monster curse card deck. If curses are distributed at the beginning of a scenario, distribute them as evenly as possible to all those affected, with players deciding cases of ambiguity. 57Player Rules Can I say X or Y at the beginning of the round when choosing my cards? As long as you avoid specific numerical values and card titles, you can say whatever you want. Can I play a card just for the experience? You have to perform at least one part of the action on the card to gain the experience. If it just says \"Attack,\" you have to attack an enemy to get the experience. If it has \"Attack\" and \"Move,\" however, you can just move and not attack and still get the experience. A larger experience symbol sitting on its own on an action is not meant to be tied to any specific ability in the action. Can I choose not to gain the experience from using an action?

No, experience is not optional. If I am level 9, can I still earn experience? You can still track experience when you are level 9 as a metric for how well you are doing in the scenario, but experience no longer gives you any long-term benefits. Can I choose to not perform specific parts of an action and what is considered a negative effect? You can choose not perform any or all parts of an action except the following: 1. Negative effects: Effects that when performed will (not may) reduce hit points, lose cards, or apply anegative condition to yourself or an ally . 2. Stand alone infusions (i.e. not attached to a specific ability). Note that infusions gained from modifiercards are considered attached to the attack so they can be skipped. Also, at least one ability on the action must be performed in order to gain the Infusion. 3. XP granting abilities, whether stand alone or attached to another ability. If stand alone, at least oneability on the action must be performed in order to gain the XP. 4. +/- X ability adjustments from modifier cards.You cannot change the order of the abilities in the action, though. Can I decide not to loot money or treasure tiles in my hex at the end of my turn? End-of-turn looting is not optional. If there are money or treasure tiles in your hex at the end of your turn, you have to loot them. Are there restrictions on what I can loot with a Loot ability in regards to line-of-sight or obstacles? The specific mechanics are that you can loot all hexes within range X of you, where X refers to \"Loot X.\" This means that if you can target the hex with an attack in that range, you can loot the hex. This means loot is unaffected by monsters or obstacles, but is affected by line-of-sight. Any enemy or scenario effect forces me onto a hex with loot, can I automatically pick it up, like end-of-turn looting? No, end-of-turn looting happens only at the end of your turn. You cannot automatically pick up loot at any other time. 58 If I loot, say, an armor item from a treasure tile and I am already wearing armor, what happens? You can own any number of items (but only one copy of each). It is not limited only to what you can equip. So when you find armor in a chest and already have armor, you still get to keep the armor you got, you just won't be able to equip it until next scenario. Actually, since you can only equip items in between scenarios, even if you weren't wearing armor, you'd still have to wait to equip the armor you just got. So what if I loot an item I already had a copy of? In this case, you would immediately gain the sell value of the item you looted (half the buy value), and place that copy of the item in the city's available supply of items if it was not already there. If I play a card for its basic action, but the corresponding action on the card has the lose symbol, do I still lose the card? No, only if you perform that specific action text does the lose symbol take effect. If I recover cards during my second action, can I recover the card I just played with my first action? Yes. As soon as a card is used, it is placed in the appropriate pile, so if your first card played is lost, you could recover it with your second card if it allows for such. What is the designation of cards in my active area? Are they considered in my hand or in their own class or what?

What is the designation of cards in my active area? Are they considered in my hand or in their own class or what? Cards in your active area are technically considered discarded or lost (depending on whether there was a lost symbol on the action you played to put them there), even when they are in your active area. When you recover discard cards (by resting, for example) or lost cards (through special actions), you have the choice of picking up corresponding cards in your active area or leaving them in play. This also means they are not in your hand and cannot be put in your lost pile to negate damage (unless you are move two discards to your lost pile, as per the normal rules). If I consume an element in the strong column, does it go down to waning or all the way down to inert? Whenever an element is consumed, it always moves down to inert, no matter where it started. Can you explain the timing of elemental infusions? Yes, the main take-away here is that any elements you create on your turn do not get moved to the strong column until the end of your turn. This means that you cannot create an element (that wasn't already present) and then consume it on the same turn because it won't be available to be consumed until the end of your turn. On the up side, this also means that if an element is already strong or waning at the start of your turn, you can create the element again with your first action, consume the existing element with your second action, and then the element will still go up to strong at the end of your turn even though you just used it. Is there any difference between an attack effect (elemental infusion, negative condition, etc.) caused by attack modifier, an item card, or one printed on the ability card itself? No, whether an attack effect is added by a modifier card, an item card or the ability card itself, it 59 functions exactly the same. When I do a long rest, when do the effects (healing, getting your discards back, refreshing spent items) take place? Your full rest happens on initiative 99, so you have to wait until the end of the round to gain the effects. If I have zero cards in my hand and two cards in my discard, can I still long rest even though I will become exhausted at the beginning of the next round? Absolutely. You can stick around for one more round as a meat shield. Also consider the following question. If I long rest, do my summons still get a turn during the round? Yes, they will act directly before initiative 99 as normal. Do summons perform end-of-turn looting? No, only characters perform end of turn looting. If a summon has a \"-\" for its move or attack, can I grant it move or attack actions, respectively? It depends. The \"-\" means that it has no base for that stat. So you cant' grant an \"Attack +2\" action to a summon with a \"-\", as that is a modifier to an undefined base, but you can grant it an \"Attack 2\" action, as that sets the base. The same applies to movement. Also note that summons (or monsters) with \"-\" movement can still be pushed and pulled. If I long rest, do I still technically have a turn for the round? Yes, on initiative 99, you perform the effects of the long rest, and it is considered a turn, so you can still use items or do other things you would normally be able to do on your turn (unless you are stunned, in which case you are only allowed to perform the effects of the long rest). What's the difference between an attack and an attack action? And attack is a single attack on a single target that flips over a single attack modifier card. And attack action constitutes all the attacks made with a specific action (entire top or bottom half of an ability card). If your attack action is, say, \"Attack 3,\" then there is only one attack in your attack action.

And attack action constitutes all the attacks made with a specific action (entire top or bottom half of an ability card). If your attack action is, say, \"Attack 3,\" then there is only one attack in your attack action. If it is \"Attack 2, Target 3,\" then your attack action consists of three separate attacks. If an ability allows me to \"kill\" an enemy, is that considered an attack? No, unless the ability says \"attack,\" it is not an attack. What if I consume an element to turn an attack action into a kill action? So long as you consume the element and trigger only the kill effect, the word \"instead\" negates the attack, and it is no longer an attack. If I kill an enemy with my attack damage, can I still apply the effects of the attack (i.e., curse, push, etc.)? No, added attack effects are always applied after the damage. If you kill an enemy with the damage, 60 then it is no longer around to be pushed onto a trap or cursed. Do I have to push or pull the full amount? Like any added effect, you can choose not to apply it, but if you do, you have to use the full push or pull effect. The only time the full push or pull may not go into effect is if there are obstacles or figures in the way and you may chose a blocked direction even if an unblocked one is available (note, however, that you can push or pull enemies through other enemy figures, they just can't end the movement in the same hex). Also keep in mind that if multiple push or pull effects are applied with the same ability (due to attack modifier cards), you can choose to apply or not apply them separately (e.g. if your ability applied a \"push 1,\" and your attack modifier card applied a \"push 1,\" you could decide to push 0, 1 or 2 since they are separate effects). Can I target allies with push/pull abilities? No, allies cannot be targeted at all, even if the ability isn't an Attack. Can flying monsters be pushed into traps? The can be pushed into hexes with traps, but doing so will not trigger the traps. If an enemy dies from trap damage, who gets credit for the kill? The credit goes to whomever causes the trap to be sprung, not the whomever who made it. If the enemy moves onto a trap on its own, no one would get the credit. If an enemy dies from WOUND, who gets credit for the kill? No one. If I end my turn on a hex with hazardous terrain, do I take any additional damage? No, you only take damage when you enter the hex. When exactly does retaliate trigger? Retaliate triggers after all effects of an attack have been applied. If the retaliating figure dies from the attack, the retaliate does not trigger because the figure is removed from the board beforehand. If the retaliating figure is pushed out of the range of its retaliate, it also does not trigger. However, if it is pulled into retaliate range, it would trigger. Is retaliation targeted? If I am invisible, can monsters still retaliate against me? Retaliation is not targeted, so it is unaffected by invisibility. You can still be retaliated against while invisible. Can I hit my allies with area attacks? No, unless the action specifically states that you do. An area effect ability shows you the hexes that you can target with an attack, and you cannot target allies with attacks under any circumstances, so, in general, allies are safe from your abilities.

If I am invisible, can monsters still retaliate against me? Retaliation is not targeted, so it is unaffected by invisibility. You can still be retaliated against while invisible. Can I hit my allies with area attacks? No, unless the action specifically states that you do. An area effect ability shows you the hexes that you can target with an attack, and you cannot target allies with attacks under any circumstances, so, in general, allies are safe from your abilities. Certain classes (the Cragheart, for example), however, have abilities that specifically state that allies in certain situations suffer damage or gain negative conditions, but these cases are clearly stated on the ability cards. 61 What are the line-of-sight rules? Line-of-sight is necessary for all attacks (including every hex of an area attack) and all other abilities that specify a range (including looting, which technically has a range). Any non-attack ability that does not specify a range does not require line-of-sight. Can I target empty hexes with an area attack? While you are not technically \"targeting\" the empty hex, the hex of an area attack that is within the range specified by the attack can be empty. It can even be a wall, so long as there are enemies in the attack area that are in your line-of-sight. Are there any line of sight or adjacency restrictions on what I can target with a melee area attack (area attack containing a grey hex)? The only restriction, as above, is that you have to have line of sight on a figure to target it with an attack. Other than that, if the hex is in the configuration shown on the card, you can attack it. If my area of effect for an attack is chiral (not equal to its mirror image) can I use the mirror image of the area instead? Yes, in addition to applying any rotation to an area of effect, you can also use the mirror image of the area. How does Add Target interact with area attacks? Add Target always adds a single extra target within the range of your attack to the attack, and this target cannot be an enemy already targeted by the attack (a single attack ability cannot target the same enemy multiple times). So if you got an Add Target effect on an area attack, you could pick one enemy within range but outside of the area (because all enemies in the area are already getting attacked) to get hit by the attack as well. All conditions and other effects of the attack (other than effects that would add additional attack targets) would apply to the added target, as well. Each instance of the Add Target effect adds an additional target to the attack using the above guidelines. Note that if an attack ability targets everything within a specified range, Add Target would do nothing since you are already targeting everything in that range. If I take one point of damage from an attack and have multiple abilities (from ability cards or items) which give me Shield when taking damage from an attack, do I have to use all of them? No. You can choose which Shield bonus to apply in this case, and once the damage is reduced to zero, it is no longer a source of damage, so any other bonuses do not have to be used. What exactly is considered using an item? Any instance of you applying the effects of an item card to a situation is considered a use. When exactly can I use an item? Can I use it in the middle of a movement or other ability? You can use an item pretty much whenever you want, within the restrictions of what is written on the item card. So if it says \"on your turn,\" use it any time you want on your turn, including during a movement or after you have taken all your actions. The only restriction is that if an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, adds an effect, adds advantage or disadvantage), it has to be used before an 62 attack modifier is drawn. Is there any limitation to the number of items I can use on my turn or even during the same ability? No. If I apply POISON with my attack, does it immediately give me +1 on the attack? No. All added effects of an attack are only applied after the amount of damage is resolved. The one exception to this is PIERCE, which is applied at the same time as the damage.

No. All added effects of an attack are only applied after the amount of damage is resolved. The one exception to this is PIERCE, which is applied at the same time as the damage. If I have both the WOUND and POISON conditions and am healed, what happens? Both conditions are removed and no actual healing takes place. Does a long rest cure WOUND and POISON? Does drinking a potion cure WOUND and POISON? Yes, these are both considered \"Heal\" effects and thus interact with WOUND and POISON like other \"Heal\" abilities. If a heal or other beneficial ability specifies a range, can I target myself? Yes. How do the heal rolling modifier cards work? Any time a \"Heal\" attack modifier card is resolved, the figure who flipped it heals the amount specified. This heal can remove wound and poison like any other heal. If I get stunned before I have a chance to play my cards for the round, do I have to discard them, or can I take them back and do a full rest? You have to discard them. If I have advantage or disadvantage, how do I determine whether one attack modifier card is better or worse in the case of effects beyond the typical +/- modifiers? How do I know when something is ambiguous? All added effects (negative conditions, elements, healing, etc.) have a positive but undefined value. Thus, these would be the rulings in the following cases: +1 vs +2: +2 is better +1 Stun vs +1: +1 Stun is better +0 Stun vs +2: Ambiguous +1 Stun vs +1 Fire: Ambiguous +0 Muddle vs +2 Stun: Ambiguous Is it ever possible to do damage with an attack after the \"no damage\" attack modifier card takes effect? No. If this card is applied to your attack, you do no direct damage with the attack under any circumstances. If a condition lasts until the end of my next turn, what exactly does \"next turn\" mean? 63 \"Next turn\" means your next full turn. So if you start a turn with the condition in effect, then at the end of that turn, it is removed. If a monster stuns you on its turn, then your next turn (whether that happens in the current round or the following round) you would be under the effect of stun, and then it would go away at the end of that turn. If you manage to get stunned on your own turn, you would immediately suffer the effects, then you would also suffer from the effects on your following turn in the following round before the effect wore off at the end of that turn. This also applies to conditions on monsters. Can I voluntarily end positive conditions on myself like Strengthen and Invisible? No. Am I an ally of myself? No. If I draw two 'heal self' rolling modifiers in the same attack, is one heal performed or two? Heals from rolling modifiers stack into a single Heal. Are abilities that target a single figure with an attack but damage additional figures via other non-attack effects (like suffer damage) still considered single target attacks? Yes. Can you perform a Move X ability but do 0 move? Yes. Do persistent cards that trigger \"at the end of your next X turns\" also trigger at the end of the current turn? Yes. Should curses and blesses be removed from a player's modifier deck immediately when becoming exhausted so that other players and monsters can use them? As per the rules, they are not removed until the end of the scenario. What is the difference between \"Ability +X\" vs \"Ability X\" character ability cards granting other figures extra actions? \"Ability +X\" makes an adjustment to an existing ability while \"Ability X\" grants the figure a new ability. What happens if a figure is poisoned and a \"Heal all\" ability is used on it? The heal ability is treated just like other heal abilities, so the poison is removed but no damage is healed.

Can you use a heal ability on a figure that is already at full health? Yes. Can you perform an elemental infusion or a gain XP, either of which are printed as stand-alone segments of an action, by itself without doing another ability of the action? No. This also applies to the lost card symbol. You must perform some ability of the action to actually lose 64 the card. When a multi target attack has a Gain XP effect, do I get XP for each target? Only if the card specifically says so. Can a figure still perform actions prevented by immobilize and stun even if those actions are granted to the figure outside their turn? No. The \"on their turn\" phrase listed in the condition section of the rule book should not be there. When is an ability considered a \"Targeted\" ability? When the card says \"Target\" or \"Attack\" How does stun work with persistent effects and passive items? Stun does not affect them, they function normally. Can I use items outside of my turn? Only if the item is used as a reaction to an enemy action. Otherwise, items cannot be used unless it is your turn. Does overkill damage count for abilities that say \"amount of damage inflicted\"? Yes. Can you do a short rest in the last round of a scenario? Yes. When summons attack obstacles, what initiative value do the obstacles have when resolving tie-breakers for monster focus? Obstacles have 99 initiative for resolving focus ties. What exactly is the timing of a figure's turn? A figure's turn starts when the previous figure ends their turn and ends when the next figure begins theirs. What happens when a figure becomes immune to a condition that it already has? The condition is removed. Note this does not apply to Curse and Bless. Those immunities prevent the card from entering the modifier deck; they do not prevent existing curse/bless cards from being drawn and applying their effect. 65Monster Turns I'm just confused about focus. Can you explain it? Finding a focus for a monster can be tricky in certain circumstances, but it follows some very basic rules. First of all, is the monster performing an attack on the ability card it drew? If not, pretend as if it is performing a melee attack (i.e. it wants to be adjacent to an enemy). Next, find the minimum distance it needs to move to get within range (and line-of-sight) to attack an enemy. It doesn't matter if the monster can't get within range with the movement it has, as long as there is a path to eventually get within range, it will still consider this path the optimal path. The enemy/enemies that are within range (and line-of-sight) at the end of this shortest path are considered the \"closest.\" Side note on negative hexes (traps or hazardous terrain): negative hexes are considered obstacles when determining this path unless there is no path except through the negative hexes. The path can be ten steps long if the enemy avoids the negative hex and two steps long if it goes through the negative hex, it will still choose the ten-step path as long as it is available. Basically, monsters will move through as few negative hexes as possible. In the case where the monster can move the same number of spaces to get within range (and line-of-sight) of multiple enemies (either because it starts its turn within range or multiple enemies or through some other situation), proximity (i.e. number of hexes they are away, not counting through walls) is then checked as a tie-breaker for \"closest.\" Okay, now, if there is only one closest enemy within range at the end of that path, that is the monster's focus. If there are multiple closest enemies within range (and line-of-sight), the focus is the enemy among those tied who has the lower initiative for the round.", "start_char_idx": 143425, "end_char_idx": 147893, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e5ea81c-92de-411c-9342-999b08a5827a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e5ea81c-92de-411c-9342-999b08a5827a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d48c514e-cf77-47ca-ba26-49995e02b071", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "fd75246be22b0430a0d61f219690bb638e8e47658273ebaa8b2ba65319298699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe1151b7-66e6-402b-8246-e8cb3d891fa1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "dce3f49d8121a2e1f93d05d0b895078cdea52b8452234131506da0a156e96caa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ccc53cbf-b41b-4c61-b696-ac552e76f2f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c81aef6720727ada31eb638cb58e5f750860b6a38a75e4f18f8d7eca027accb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The path can be ten steps long if the enemy avoids the negative hex and two steps long if it goes through the negative hex, it will still choose the ten-step path as long as it is available.

If there are multiple closest enemies within range (and line-of-sight), the focus is the enemy among those tied who has the lower initiative for the round. Note that there may be some cases where a monster can't find a focus at all. In order to obtain focus on an enemy, there must be an unblocked path to an open hex where it could eventually move to and target the enemy. If an enemy can't find a focus, it doesn't move or attack on its turn and just performs any other abilities written on its card. Can you explain in more detail how monsters interact with invisible characters? Invisibility works the same regardless of whether it is an invisible character or an invisible monster. Monsters can't focus on invisible characters, move through them (unless flying or jumping), or target them with any attacks or other targeted abilities (an ability like \"CURSE, target all enemies within range,\" for instance, wouldn't affect the invisible character even if he/she were in range). Monsters essentially treat invisible characters like obstacles, but may occasionally affect them with non-target effects (such as splash damage). Once again, however, an invisible character will never be focused on by a monster. Invisibility can create an edge-case where a monster is unable to find a focus, either because all of its enemies are invisible, or an invisible character is standing in a door or some other one-hex passageway to prevent a monster from finding any viable path to get within range of an enemy. Blocking a passageway like this doesn't always result in not finding focus. Flying or jumping enemies can ignore the obstacle (invisible character), and ranged enemies may still be able over it, depending on the value of their range and the positions of the other characters. 66 If a monster can't get within range to attack with its movement, will it still move closer? Absolutely, monsters will always use the minimum movement required to get as close as possible to a hex where they can attack their focus, attempting to get into a position where they can attack with maximum efficiency if possible (e.g. avoiding disadvantage (first priority) or maximizing attacks on other targets (second priority)). Closeness is measured by the minimum total number of hexes the monster needs to physically move to reach the desired hex. Will a monster move away from a character if it is adjacent and is performing a ranged attack? Yes, as a general rule, monsters move a minimum amount to maximize their attack, so they will move one hex away to lose disadvantage. If a monster ability card doesn't specify an \"Attack\" or \"Move\" ability, do they still perform that ability? No. Monsters only do what is written on their card for that round. If an ability card for a monster that normally has range shows a hex configuration with a grey hex (normally signifying a melee attack), is this attack still considered ranged? No, in this case, it would perform a melee attack. If a monster is disarmed, will it move as if it has an attack? No, disarm negates all effects of having an attack. A monster will move as though it doesn't have an attack, which means it will just try to get as close as possible to its focus. If a monster has bonuses like \"Shield\" or \"Retaliate\" on their ability card, is that active for the whole round? No, bonuses only become active once the monster takes their turn based on the initiative on the ability card. It then lasts until the end of the round, where it will either get shuffled back into the deck or replaced with the next round's ability card. How are these bonuses affected by stunning a monster?

A monster will move as though it doesn't have an attack, which means it will just try to get as close as possible to its focus. If a monster has bonuses like \"Shield\" or \"Retaliate\" on their ability card, is that active for the whole round? No, bonuses only become active once the monster takes their turn based on the initiative on the ability card. It then lasts until the end of the round, where it will either get shuffled back into the deck or replaced with the next round's ability card. How are these bonuses affected by stunning a monster? Note that the bonuses are not simply given by the monster ability card. Monsters would have to perform a \"Shield 1\" action to gain the Shield 1, so these bonuses only activate if a monster is not stunned on its turn. When a monster type activates, do they all go on the same turn, or does each individual monster have a separate turn? Each individual monster has a separate turn. If a monster type consumes an element due to its ability card, does only the first monster who acts gain the effect or all the monsters? When monsters consume an element, all monsters of that type gain the benefit when they activate. If two different monster types reveal the same initiative on different ability cards, which one goes first? 67 The players decide. How do you distinguish between summoned enemies and other enemies (since summoned enemies don't drop money tokens)? You can place extra scenario tokens (grey circles) on summoned enemies if you have difficulty keeping track. When something that summons monsters dies, do the monsters it summoned die too? No. If a boss is immune to CURSE, what happens if it draws a CURSE card? The card affects the boss normally (i.e. the boss does no damage). Note that it is only immune to the condition, which is the act of shuffling the CURSE card into the deck. Are bosses elites? No, bosses are their own class of monster and are thus unaffected by abilities that target normal or elite monsters. Also note that named monsters specified in the scenario book are their own class of monster as well. Are obstacles with hit points considered enemies? Can they poisoned, wounded, etc.? Obstacles with hit points are technically considered enemies for all ability purposes, but they are immune to all negative conditions. If a door is closed due to specific scenario rules, what happens if revealed monsters are stuck in a room with no enemies to attack? Closed doors behave like walls. The monsters are still revealed, so they would still play a card at the beginning of each round, but, until the door is opened, they wouldn't be able to find a focus, and so would not move or attack and just perform any other abilities on their card, as per the normal rules. Do negative conditions from monster ability cards stack with traits of the same negative condition (ex: monster has Curse trait for every attack and draws an ability with a Curse as well)? Yes. What happens if a flying monster is over a stun trap and another monster attempts to move over that stun trap? A figure cannot end their turn in the same hex as another figure so treat the flying monster as an obstacle when determining the non-flying monster's movement. If a monster ability card lists a melee attack (like \"adjacent enemies\" effects) but the monster stat card specifies a Range X, is the attack melee or ranged? It is melee, the monster ability card takes precedence. When a monster is controlled by a character, is it considered an ally or an enemy of other monsters 68 while it is being controlled? It is considered an enemy by other monsters. 69Campaign When I level up, does my experience go back to zero? No. How exactly does my \"pool\" of ability cards work? What can I add to it when I level up? Your pool of ability cards is the set of cards you can choose to add to your hand when you start a scenario. The cards in your hand are the cards you actually play the scenario with and their number is limited based on the class you are playing. When you are starting out with a level 1 character, your pool consists of all level 1 cards, plus the three \"X\" cards in your deck as well. All other cards are unavailable to you. When you level up, you can take a single card of your new level or lower from the deck of unavailable cards and add it to your pool. In this manner, a level 9 character will add eight more cards to their pool over the course of leveling up from level 1.", "start_char_idx": 150767, "end_char_idx": 155253, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f074cf15-3c4a-4048-b904-f456762730b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f074cf15-3c4a-4048-b904-f456762730b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d48c514e-cf77-47ca-ba26-49995e02b071", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "fd75246be22b0430a0d61f219690bb638e8e47658273ebaa8b2ba65319298699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccc53cbf-b41b-4c61-b696-ac552e76f2f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "K:\\Coding\\Gloombot2\\preprocessed\\gh_summ.txt", "file_name": "gh_summ.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 177264, "creation_date": "2024-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-24"}, "hash": "fcf6054297fdf2a0d3f70475dfd9737359716a71f498ed856768de6c936011c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb3e339a-a007-4925-aa66-bd631fd62513", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cad31bfabc7899127c3c098e0ddb9ea9a47ba5fecc4d6989cd256ede2157c81a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "No. How exactly does my \"pool\" of ability cards work?

In this manner, a level 9 character will add eight more cards to their pool over the course of leveling up from level 1. If a perk on a character sheet has multiple check boxes next to it, does that mean it requires that number of check marks to unlock it, or that I can acquire that perk for one check that number of times? The second case. If a perk has two check boxes, you can gain that perk twice for one perk allocation each. Can I choose not to level up when I have the experience or not gain a perk when I have three check marks? No. If you are in town and you have enough experience to level up, you are forced to do so, immediately gaining all benefits of leveling up. If you have three check marks, you must immediately gain a perk. If I lose a check mark, can that make me lose a perk? No. You cannot go below the threshold of a perk, experience level, or prosperity level when losing check marks, experience, or prosperity, respectively. So if you have three check marks (enough to gain a perk), and then lose a check mark, nothing happens. You don't lose a perk, and you don't go into check mark debt. If we fail a scenario, can we immediately retry it? Yes, your party location is still considered to be at that scenario, so you can fully recover hit points, cards, etc. and immediately do the scenario again without doing a road event, or you can return to town or do another scenario, but that may necessitate a road event before starting a scenario depending on the linking rules. Do I do a road event when traveling back to Gloomhaven from a scenario? No, you only do a road event when traveling to a scenario. If the party wants to go directly to a linked scenario but wants to swap out characters in between, does the party have to go back to Gloomhaven, thereby forcing them to take a road event before the linked scenario? 70 If the character being swapped in has already been created, then you don't have to go back to Gloomhaven, but if you want to swap in a character that hasn't been created yet, you would have to return to Gloomhaven to create it. Do I get the money and treasure tiles left on the ground when I finish a scenario? No, all loot left on the ground is lost once the scenario is over. You have to pick it up during the scenario. If you want the treasure tiles that you weren't able to pick up, you will have to play through the scenario again. How do I track lost prosperity? Note it next to the prosperity track and then scratch out the note the next time you gain prosperity. Do I keep my personal quest secret? There's not an official rule on this, so do whatever you want. I like to keep mine secret. Which event rewards/penalties affect a single character and which affect all characters? If a result starts with \"Gain,\" \"Lose,\" \"Discard,\" or \"Consume,\" the result is distributed among all characters however they choose if the word \"collective\" is included (i.e. \"Lose 10 collective gold.\" means that the party loses 10 gold total). The result affects each character separately if the word \"each\" is included (i.e. \"Lose 10 gold each.\" means that a party of 4 would lose 40 gold total). The exception to this is if the result is gaining an item. In that case, only one character gets the item (decided among the players). If a result contains \"Start scenario with...\" it affects all players, unless it says \"One starts scenario with...\" in which case it only affects one player.

All treasure results (with the following two exceptions) affect only the character that loots the treasure tile. The exceptions are the \"Random Side Scenario\" reward, which unlocks a new scenario for the entire campaign, and the \"Random Item Design\" reward, which places a set of items in the shop for anyone in the campaign to purchase. For the BLESS and STRENGTHEN enhancements, what abilities count as targeting allies or yourself? If an ability has a targeting qualification below it (e.g. \"Self\" or \"Affect all allies at X range\" or simply \"Range X\"), and it is a beneficial ability, then you can enhance it with Bless/Strengthen (as long as it has a dot, of course). A \"Move\" ability does not count as targeting yourself. 71 If I play a random dungeon from the random dungeon deck, do they trigger road events and city events like normal scenarios? No. Random dungeons will not progress the campaign in any way. This means they do not trigger road or city events, unlock new scenarios, gain town prosperity or anything else that would impact the campaign world. They can, however, help with character progression, in the form of experience, gold, checks, and personal quests. If a scenario's requirements have an achievement listed as \"INCOMPLETE,\" what does that mean? It means that you can only play that scenario in campaign mode if you do not have the listed achievement. If a scenario is actually in the town of Gloomhaven, would interacting with the town both before and after the scenario be considered separate visits (for the purposes of donating to the sanctuary and city events)? Yes. Do I have to win a scenario to complete it? Yes. If I loot a \"goal\" treasure tile in a scenario and then go back to do the scenario again, is the treasure tile still looted? No, unlike numbered treasure tiles, \"goal\" treasure tiles are reset at the end of every scenario and must be looted again. If I unlock a character class through means other than retirement and it is already unlocked, do I still get the bonus of a random scenario and item design? Yes. No matter how a character class is unlocked, if you trigger the unlock and it is already unlocked, you gain the bonus of a random scenario and item design. How are sanctuary donations and city events handled when playing scenarios in casual mode? Sanctuary donations and city events can only be done if the last scenario played was in campaign mode. 72Personal Quests What scenarios are considered to be inside Gloomhaven?

You also get credit for kills if your summon lands the killing blow. If I fulfill the conditions of my personal quest and then do something so that they are no longer fulfilled, do I still retire?  No, you must be fulfilling the conditions of your personal quest at the time you retire. For quest cards 510, 513, 521, 526, and 529, I have to fulfill some condition and then unlock a scenario. Does the scenario unlock automatically once the condition is fulfilled or do I have to do something else to unlock it? The scenario is unlocked when you fulfill the condition. You don't need to do anything else to unlock it. For quest cards 510, 521, 522, 526, 528, and 529, do these have to be different scenarios? Yes. For quest card 514, can I experience this even if I am exhausted? Yes. Note that your own exhaustion does not count, though. For quest card 515 and 520, do I have to that many monsters total or that many of each monster 73 listed? That many monsters total. For quest card 517, what counts as different monster types? Each monster stat card (the large square ones) depicts a different monster type. So, for instance, Inox Guards and Bandit Guards are two different monster types and each different boss is a different monster type. Do random scenarios count for quest card 518? Yes. For quest card 519, can I lose progress for this if I lose check marks through events? Do I gain progress if I gain check marks through events or bonuses other than battle goals? No, only battle goals count as progress towards this quest. It may be necessary to track this separately in the notes section. 74Scenarios Scenario 9: TYPO - The boss abilities are switched in the scenario book. \"Boss Special 1\" should be labeled \"Boss Special 2\" and vice versa.

If the player holding the items is exhausted, the scenario is failed. If the scenario is failed, the items are returned to the treasure tile and you can loot it again on your next attempt.

The first thing you should do when starting a scenario (after going through a Road Event when applicable), is look in the scenario book to get the map tiles set up, all the monsters you will be fighting prepared, and apply any negative scenario effects. Next, you should deal battle goals and choose one. After choosing your battle goals, then you can decided which items you would like to equip from the ones you own (adding in -1 cards to you attack modifier deck when applicable) and which ability cards you would like to start with from the pool of those you have available to you. If I am forced to discard cards because of an event, when does that happen? Even though events happen before setting up the scenario, you should wait until you've selected your hand of cards to decide which ones to discard. Does consuming items during a road event make them unavailable during the scenario? Yes. If I have a perk that lets me ignore scenario effects, can I ignore the negative effects of event cards? No. You can only ignore the specific effects outlined in scenarios as scenario effects. These will be listed in the special rules of a scenario and have the format of \"Do such and such as a scenario effect.\" What damaging effects are modified by attack modifier cards? Only attacks (specified by the \"Attack\" keyword) are modified by attack modifier cards. Traps, hazardous terrain, retaliate, wound, and any \"suffer X damage\" text do not cause attack modifier cards to be drawn.  Are the same differentiations used when mitigating \"damage from an attack\" versus a \"source of damage?\" Yes, when something reduces damage from an attack (namely, Shield), it is specifically referring to a figure making an \"Attack\" and flipping over an attack modifier card. If you are reducing or negating a \"source of damage,\" that can be anything: attacks, traps, hazardous terrain, retaliate, wound, suffering damage from choosing a different card to lose when short resting, or any other \"suffer X damage\" text. Can you explain the difference between an unoccupied hex and an empty hex? An unoccupied hex has no figures (monsters, characters or character summons) present. An empty hex has no figures, tokens (money or otherwise), or overlay tiles of any kind (except corridors, open doors, and pressure plates) present. Can I or one of my allies spring a trap that I lay? Can monsters spring their own traps? Yes, traps have no memory once you place them. They become hazards for everyone. If I lay a trap on an open door, and then the door closes because of a scenario rule, what happens to 78 the trap? It is removed from the board.

Can monsters spring their own traps? Yes, traps have no memory once you place them. They become hazards for everyone. If I lay a trap on an open door, and then the door closes because of a scenario rule, what happens to 78 the trap? It is removed from the board. What exactly is considered a wall? The edge of any map tile and the entire area of any partial hex along the edge are considered walls unless they are covered by a corridor tile. Doors are also considered walls when they are closed. Where the edge of a complete hex on a map tile comes up right to the edge of the tile, there is a dark border to remind you that a wall exists at that edge, though it does not technically begin (for cases of line-of-sight) until the edge. If two map tiles are set next to each other such that these dark edges line up (i.e. the border of the first and second room of the first scenario), the wall is considered to still be there as a one-dimensional line. If an enemy is on the other side of this one-dimensional wall line from me, can I hit him with a melee attack? No. All range, even range 1 melee attacks, can't be counted through walls. In fact, for all intents and purposes (including looting), these two hexes are not adjacent and considered two hexes apart. In cases of ambiguity where players decide the outcome, how should the players decide? Should they do what is best for themselves or worst for themselves? It is up to you. That is why you are deciding. It is assumed that you would decide whatever is best for you, but, again, it is up to you. If a character becomes exhausted, and then I open a door to a new room, does the room populate based on the non-exhausted player count, or the original player count? The player count that you started the scenario with. If my leading card is revealed at the start of a round, when exactly is my second card revealed? They are both revealed at the start of the round, just put your leading card on top. Once everyone has chosen their cards and revealed them, both of each player's cards are open information. What is the round tracker for? Do I need to complete all scenarios within 12 turns? No, the round tracker is only for specific scenarios. Unless the scenario has a specific reason for having you track rounds, don't worry about it. If I am exhausted during the scenario, but it is still successfully completed, is there any penalty for being exhausted? No, you earn everything that you would have earned if you hadn't become exhausted: completed battle goals, tallied money and experience, bonus completion experience, any rewards in the scenario book granted for completing the scenario like bonus gold or experience. Does becoming exhausted from lack of cards affect my hit points in any way for the purposes of the \"Fast Healer\" and \"Masochist\" battle goals? No, you can still achieve those battle goals after being exhausted if your hit points were in the correct range when you were exhausted. 79 Do I regain all my hit points once a scenario is finished? Yes. Do BLESS and CURSE cards stay in my deck once a scenario is over? No, these and any -1 cards with a star in the corner should be removed from your deck at the end of a scenario. Is there a purpose to the BLESS and CURSE punch board tokens? No. I know that if I run out of standees for a monster, no more are placed, but what if I run out of bases? Try to find a suitable replacement. Standee bases shouldn't limit monster numbers. How does failing a scenario interact with the permanent death variant? With the permanent death variant, whenever a scenario is failed through any condition, the scenario doesn't end until the end of the round in which it was failed. At this time, if any of the characters are still alive (possibly exhausted but not dead), then they would still survive.

At this time, if any of the characters are still alive (possibly exhausted but not dead), then they would still survive. Is it possible to prematurely fail a scenario to avoid death or wasting time? Not technically, no, but if there are no monsters on the board and no more will be placed on the board without player action, then all players would be free to play out however many rounds it takes to exhaust themselves without danger. If all players agree, you can save yourself the time and call the scenario failed early. What is the red starburst symbol next to traps on the monster cards from the random dungeon deck? This symbol indicates the trap is a damage trap. What happens if I run out of condition tokens? Condition tokens are not meant to limit their total usage of the condition (unlike Curse and Bless). Use another token or make a note to keep track. 80Items As a general rule, if an item adds some effect or bonus to your attack, you must decide to use it before attack modifier cards are drawn. Equipped items are active from the beginning of the scenario, such that if an item reacts to an enemies actions, it can do so immediately. Item cards with circles to track multiple uses act exactly like persistent ability cards, in that if the situation applies, you must use the item in reaction and lose a charge. Additionally, it should be noted that if the card has a spent icon in the lower right corner, it is not technically spent until all charges have been lost, and so cannot be refreshed through resting or other abilities until all charges have been used. If an item card does not have circles to track multiple uses, then you can decide when to use it - it is not mandatory.
