An example application for retrieval augmented retrievel based on LlamaIndex and Llama3. Technology Stack:
* [LLamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
* [Llama3](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama3)

LLamaIndex is used with the regular SimpleDataLoader, and Vector Store (both can be improved by using Plugins or external vector databases). 
Ollama is used for hosting the Llama3 model which of course can be used standalone.
